<h1>THE CHAD</h1>

<h2>a novel</h2>

<p>“Ethan’s eyes are green, and that’s not a fault. That’s our wisdom, shining out.” —Chad Tidwell, CTO, New Digital Controls</p>

<h3>SO MUCH FOR O’HOOLEY’S</h3>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<p>Look, I’m a respectable guy. A well-dressed guy, in a Tammy Dill button-down, braided rawhide belt, pleated Dickers, and white cross-trainers with Spring-Action soles. I have a sensibly short, gelled-but-not-spiked haircut the lightest shade of sand, plus a trim blonde mustache to match. And I don’t wear glasses. I don’t smoke. I do not drink hard alcohol. I am a member of the Presbyterian church on Shemauger road. I have donated to the Republican National Committee. I have dozens of friends located somewhere in the Chicagoland area and I’m married—to a beautiful, rail-thin, very petite woman with hair like unfinished pine, with whom I’m blessed to have a newly-born son and another joy on the way—forty-one days in, thank you. We live in a spacious house—6,525 feet of spacious house to be precise—in the newest subdivision of Schaumburg—Candlewood Green, a clean-and-safe neighborhood close to shopping. I’m only 28, so is she. Our parents are still alive, and I have season Bears tickets. I understand the value of a tasteful suit. So I have no reason to feel less-than-happy. Even if I did just lose my job. I have no reason to doubt anything. Plenty of things are still respectably in place. And plenty of people are worse off than I am.</p>

<p>Take for example, this Renaldo. In the mirror behind the bar, I look younger than Renaldo, who is younger than me. And more tan, and more lined. And has sagging dark circles under his eyes, and smokes. He smokes like a gay Frenchman, this Renaldo. And has a damp nest of ponytailed hair and a goatee. Very fag, that goatee. Right now his damp ponytailed hair smells a bit like a petting zoo. He slouches, I sit up straight. So—who’s more likely to invite conversation? To attract and influence people? Who are people likely to follow down from the office? Me—looking like a man who lives a good life and knows it &#8230; or Renaldo—looking like one that people know to leave alone: a droopy desperado. Especially with the way his eyes roll to dog the tightly-clad rear end of our bartender, a blonde, deeply tan, Australian-sounding girl who just moments ago scoffed at me—which scoffing, I know, undermines my case. But think about it: even if she did laugh at me, Renaldo was looking at her so longingly I thought I’d strike up a conversation with her, out of charity for him. I pointed out, to her, that she had a pretty weird accent, and asked if it was Australian. She laughed the way people laugh at dumb questions and informed me she was from South Africa, quite a different country indeed. Then they both laughed. Them against me. And I laughed with them; I was gracious. And always am.</p>

<p>As it turns out, they’ve met before: I let them talk. It gives me a good feeling to know I’ve broken the ice—this is the reward of charity. Every year I make a large donation to The Salvation Army, and the feeling of satisfaction I get from checking over the receipt with its circled total representing a nudge toward a lower tax bracket is the same warm feeling I get seeing the results of my generosity here. Within a minute, they are refreshing each other on names: “What was yours—? Was it—Ronald? &#8230; Renaldo, ah, yes, Renaldo! It has a wonderful poetry to it, doesn’t it?” And Renaldo: “Julia, right? That’s a very pretty name.”</p>

<p>“But Renaldo,” she says, “Is a brilliant name: Renaldo—brilliant!”</p>

<p>Renaldo is a jackass name. Especially for a white guy from Naperville. My own name is Chad Tidwell. I like the sound of it—sounds like the kind of guy people can trust. Renaldo is a black guy’s name. The only Renaldo I ever knew was at church-camp, a kid who threw my Sowackum leather boat shoes in a clogged toilet. I told on him. The camp counselor was a new-age wimp who made me fish out the shoes and apologize for lying. He said I was an attention-getter and I should consider those less fortunate than myself. Church-camp Renaldo never got in trouble. When I confronted him on my own and asked him to buy me a new pair, he said, “Shut Up, Mark-ass,” and slapped me. Slapped me! He didn’t get in trouble for that either. It didn’t matter. I know he didn’t get any satisfaction from it. I didn’t show him that it hurt; instead I smiled, told him my name wasn’t Mark, it was Chad. He didn’t get the joke, only thought I was confused. He was confused that I was confused. And in his confusion at my own confusion, my advantage was clear. It was a tactic that would serve me well, against Renaldos of all stripes.</p>

<p>Not that I have anything against this Renaldo. Not too much, that is. I have to give him kudos for being the only one in the office who said he’d get a beer with me. Even if he did sort of disappear on me after saying that. And even if I’ve been leery of him from the day he walked into the office back in June. And even if I hate the way he talks and the way he draws attention to himself, and the way he seems to get things done without actually working. Even if he has a ripe European odor much like the smell of Shetland Ponies, and even if I didn’t actually okay his hire, because Tony went over my head, because I happened to take the only sick day I’ve ever taken in four years—even if Renaldo is the price I paid for a particularly extended Sunday Drive.</p>

<p>See, he is one of these people who “fancy” themselves bohemian. I almost have the nerve to tell him that there’s hardly room for bohemianism in the New Economy, that the dot-com boom may have been kicked off by pot-heads dinking around with their Friggintoshes but the dot-com crash is run by respectable entrepreneurs—realists—not idealists with their heads in the ripe European odors. It’s run by sensible, respectable, upstanding, erect, ethical people: because it has to be. And that’s why I am in charge of Renaldo, and not vice-versa.</p>

<p>After the all-hands today, I sent out an email inviting everyone to join me at O’Hooley’s for one last happy hour. No surprise that I didn’t get any replies: everyone was busy packing up. Most people didn’t even return after lunch. No one had bothered to turn on the overhead fluorescents, so the office was dark, extra dark. Nothing was visible outside the windows but rivulets and a gray wall of cloud. November had surrounded us. There were green-faced paper witches and orange jack-o-lanterns in the trash cans but no one had bothered to take down the purple ghosts from the kitchen lounge. When it was down to me and Stephanie and Renaldo, I could see across the empty desks to Renaldo’s face, cathode-ray white: a hippy vampire. I emailed him again—subject: final happy hour head count (repost). Then, to be sure he got it, I yelled across the way: “Renaldo! I sent you an email!” He nodded. In a few seconds, I got an email saying he was up for it. So I emailed back, Where do you want to go? And he emailed, I’ll let you know before I leave. And I emailed, Sounds good, pal&#8230; . And then I sent another one saying, How about we take off in 45?</p>

<p>Forty minutes later, I was coming back to my desk from the bathroom and Renaldo’s workstation was off, his desk vacated.</p>

<p>Calmly I strode over to Stephanie’s desk. I asked if she was coming down for a drink, to say goodbye, and she told me no, her cat was sick. She had to start looking for another job right away. As she spoke, she was trying to shove a desk lamp in her duffel bag. Morale was very low: people had been looting all day. I had made a few cautionary comments when I saw our Network Admin lining his pockets with laptop RAM, but he gave me such a look of despair that I cut myself off midsentence. For Steph too, I decided to maintain aloofness. I knew it was a company lamp but I chose wisely not to say anything. Instead, I asked if she’d seen Renaldo. She said she saw him like ten minutes ago heading out the door, didn’t know where he was going. I asked for her best guess. She was shaking her head. I couldn’t tell if it was because she couldn’t get the bag zipped over the lamp, or if she was getting frustrated with me. “I don’t know,” she said, forcing the head of the lamp in. “Try where he always goes on Fridays.”</p>

<p>“And where might that be?” I asked.</p>

<p>She said: “Wunder Bar.”</p>

<p>So I came here. And I found him, drinking alone. I asked where everyone else was. He asked: “Where did you come from?” I sat down, said: “I tracked you down through Stephanie, are the others coming?”</p>

<p>He said not that he knew of—as far as he knew they all went somewhere else. I said: “You mean they went somewhere else home or somewhere else another bar?”</p>

<p>After a long enough pause, I ask, “Which bar did the others go to?”</p>

<p>He rolls his eyes. “Jesus, I don’t frickin know.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t say?”</p>

<p>“No, Chad, they didn’t say.”</p>

<p>“That’s weird. I invited them all to O’Hooley’s.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you should try there,” he suggests.</p>

<p>I tsk-tsk him with pointer-fingers over the glossy bar. “Hey,” I say, grinning and wagging one of the pointer-fingers at him, “You’re just trying to get rid of me!”</p>

<p>I laugh, and he laughs, but his laugh isn’t real, and neither is mine.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I am fortunate to be married, but it’s an easy thing to be married. Luck can be engineered like anything else. Even computers have to simulate randomness, and when it’s all said and done, there is probably no true randomness in the world. Quarks will one day be explained as predictable chains of dominoes. I was “lucky” to find Jenna, but on the other hand, the fraternity system is a fortunate way to get “lucky.” It’s a lot like a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. Any time you have a party you have the frat (a P2P network) and the sorority (another P2P network) being interfaced through the house (the catalog server), so that as a young man looking for a particular kind of mate (a peer server) you can enter into a conversation (input search keywords) to determine if what you seek is available. If it is, and you have something the other person wants in return (upload:download ratio = 1:1), and the other person has time for you (slots and bandwidth) then you can trade fluids, or vows, or just get set up with her friend (hyperlink). So, you can call this “luck” if you want. I call it fortune, because it’s an advantage that comes from other advantages. I am fortunate that I went to college, but I went to college because I got good grades in high school, and I did that because my parents taught me the importance of it. So, it goes back to parents: which is what marriage has made us into.</p>

<p>And some people think it needs to be deliberated. Renaldo, for example. How logical is he, going after an Aussie (South African, whatever) who works in a place called Wunder Bar? You have plenty of opportunities in life to make intelligent decisions. Why waste them?</p>

<p>Jenna and I understood something right out of college—we got married just after graduation. She knew I would ask her, and I did. I proposed to her at Navy Pier, on the Ferris wheel, as soon as we got on. We understood this: deliberating over whether to tie the knot was a little like asking whether we should get jobs. No contest. Why make things difficult by questioning them? If you debate over whether to get a job, you are only postponing. It’s irresponsible. Just deal with things when their time comes. We understood the time had come—college was over. If I was some goofy Romantic-Renaldo, I would say the realization came on the slow traversal of the circumference of that grand wheel upon rising to the apex to view the columns of raw might and opportunity along Lake Shore Drive. But there was no “realization.” That is a term for unreal people. There was no magic. I just knew that on the Ferris Wheel would be a better place to propose than in line for the Ferris Wheel.</p>

<p>This is how we met:</p>

<p>I was on pledge duty. I was working the beer trough at the pre-Halloween after hours exchange. She was wearing the same thing as her twelve pledge sisters: a white Tri Delta t-shirt sucked into cutoffs that were just short enough in the rear to hint but not show. All their legs were brown from summer and their calves were chiseled from whatever school sports they’d ponytailed their hair for the last four years.</p>

<p>This was after they started requiring wristbands. In the old days, when my father went to the University of Illinois, they would have kegs. But too many things went wrong with kegs. There were too many Incidents. The new system was based on eliminating Incidents. The new system was safer, and I didn’t have a problem with it like some did. Why would I? The beer trough, a steel container shaped like the slot in a 5 ¼ inch floppy and filled with several hundred cans of Xtra Light in an ice bath, was a means of controlling access and quantity. To be served, you needed a wristband. Simple. The wristbands were obtained at the door with valid ID. And valid ID could be any ID. It was only the semblance of control that was necessary. The system worked through sheer rigmarole. It conditioned people to think responsibly. It was a beautiful thing. I love to see human beings organized the way an engineer would organize them. I thought of it as nearly perfect as the controlling result of a well-designed traffic grid. My pledge dad, Ray Powers, who went on to become a traffic engineer, would concur.</p>

<p>Naturally, it was tremendously funny whenever anyone would come up and ask for a beer without having a wristband. In fact, that was how I met Jenna: I laughed at her. She had the nerve to come up without a wristband and ask for a beer; I couldn’t keep from snorting loudly. So, I observed, sniggering, she didn’t have a wristband, but she was asking me to give her a beer anyway—what did she think I was, a total moron?</p>

<p>Maturity was not our strong point, at that age. She was only eighteen. From Wheaton, a dry town, and never had a drink before coming to college. I worked the usual conversation, the one I’d heard more experienced guys run through on auto-pilot, like pro athletes in a warmup routine. The bait was always in a room upstairs, a bottle of something; in this case my pledge dad’s room, a bottle of bottom-shelf Peach Schnapps. It had some flatulent name—Fropp’s Schnapps, I think it was called. “I’ve never tasted Schnapps,” she said, smiling at me like quite possibly she had. I asked if she wanted to try it. “Sure, as long as all we do is talk,” she said, smiling like maybe she wanted to do more than talk. And so I went AWOL on my pledge duty and led her upstairs to the old couch in Ray Powers’ room, the one that faced the two two-by-four bunk constructions that jutted from the far wall, each draped in sheets and flags. Below the bottom bunk, at floor level and hidden behind an upside-down Old Glory, was a third extra mattress, promised to me for the evening should I require it. The mood was perfect: lava lamp, half bottle of Fropp’s, muffled music rising from the floor. I dimmed the overhead; she canted sideways on the couch, floppy-armed. I helped her off with her shirt. She unhooked her bra. Under the bunks, ducking my head, I took off her shoes. Her lips parted in a Schnappsy smile. After I had removed her pants, her legs fell open, hot-bubble-bath-style. The light was coming red-striped and white-starred through the flag as I probed at the sharp knuckles of her dainty covering hand. She whispered that she’d never done this. She said no. I said please. She said no. I said: Please? She said no; I said are you sure; she said yes. I said yes? She said: Yes. I pushed hard, her fingers parted, I pushed, hard; it slicked in. She curled toward me for one wide-eyed moment. Then she gave way like thin ice. She kept her hand down there, her eyes staring at my shoulder. When it was over, she whispered “Did you do it inside me?” I said yes, then whispered: “I assume you’re on the pill, right?” She whispered: “Yeah, I am. But don’t do it inside me next time.” We had sex three more times that weekend. She was an accounting major, and I knew we’d have a good life.</p>

<p>She seems to remember our entire long, inter-coital conversation that evening, as if she’s gone over the night in her head many times. She says the whole night scared her, scared her in its rightness. She was already afraid to be a newcomer to a strange place, an object of rapt attention by multitudes of absolute raging horn dogs, and then suddenly, after that first time, her initial hesitation broken, nothing left to hold back, she felt comforted by me, by my immediate attention to her, by my willingness to show her again and again how it felt. It just seemed right. And yet that kind of comfort scared her even more. She told me all this during a touchy-feely conversation or two, but not until long after we had slipped into something permanent in our junior and senior years. Those were the years she started to get nostalgic. At that age, so focused on my CS classes, I barely knew what she was talking about most of the time, but it always came down to that first evening, what was done, what was said. And it would sometimes inexplicably digress into stories about high school romance, about boys who’d shocked her with the things they wanted her to do, because they’d heard such-and-such from so-and-so. And then about friends from summer camp and things they did with boys. And about camp counselors and things they did with girls. And school field trips and nature hikes. Kid’s stuff. Old crushes, that kind of thing. I didn’t see what any of it had to do with me. She swears it had something to do with me. Maybe because I said very sweet things to her that evening.</p>

<p>I never have told her the truth, that I remember very little, almost none, of that evening.</p>

<p>She told me once the feeling she had from that first night’s conversation was like exceeding the speed limit in her subdivision, in Wheaton, like her brother always did, teasing her with it, going through a 15 mile per hour speed zone at 30 miles per hour. And her brother never wore a seatbelt either—back then it wasn’t the law. That scary feeling that your brother isn’t wearing his seatbelt and you are, and it’s not against the law but it should be, and the car is doing like 30 down Cottonwood Lane and your brother is squeezing your knee the whole time and, actually, for a few seconds, you don’t care that he’s doing that. And later you don’t care because it turns out your brother squeezes everyone’s knee. Or so he said. When she told me that, I listened. I understood. I remarked that the horny sex on that particular night felt like 35, pushing 40, with the kinds of things we did. She replied, “It felt good to wake up with you. You were so nice to me that weekend. I felt like a new person waking up with you.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say to that &#8230; the set of her jaw advised: Say nothing. So I said nothing.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>It’s a simple thing to have a good life, to be a good person. We attend church every Sunday. We don’t ask for too much. We don’t expect too much. We have made a lot of money together. We feel blessed when we think of our Candlewood Green home. Its layout is tasteful, optimized for openness. We have geothermal air conditioning and solar panels. This way in the long run we save. We save money for Ethan. We’d like to see him go to a good school. But not an expensive one. Something respectable, but affordable. Like the University of Illinois. We wouldn’t discourage him if he got into University of Chicago, or Northwestern. Either one of those would be wonderful. Just wonderful. Provided he had a sizable scholarship. One that covered at least seventy percent of his tuition. We want him to understand the worth of a dollar. We want him to share our values. There is nothing wrong with making money, or with keeping the money you make. When Ethan grows up, he’ll have nothing to complain about. We give him that. It’s a humble privilege, to not find fault. Some people today find fault with everything. Sometimes, they are right. But most of the time, the fault is theirs. Inside themselves, the fault is there. Ethan’s eyes are green, and that’s not a fault. That’s our wisdom, shining out.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>We both found excellent jobs right out of school. Jenna landed a position at Arlen Arlensin; I scored an entry-level at Motomoto; we made almost 200 thou together our first year out. It felt so natural, so earned. These companies, they treated us well: 24 days of vacation, employer-matched 401ks, comprehensive health insurance at very affordable rates, quarterly bonuses, six-month reviews, five-to-ten percent pay increase each year, and yearly incentives. We worked hard. We woke before sunrise, hit the Eisenhower before the masses did, arrived by seven, worked till seven, took our work home on the weekends. We deserved what we earned. Of course, when Ethan came along, Jenna decided it was best to leave her position at Arlensin. It was the right thing to do, and I encouraged it. It was important for everyone to have some kind of professional life, I allowed, although I told her the right thing in that situation is for a mother to care for the child. There was no other sensible option. We just aren’t the kind of parents who would leave their child with some kind of hard-luck immigrant, for example. I told Jenna over and over it was definitely the right thing to do. And it turned out just fine, because I quickly found a new position heading up the engineering department here in the Loop. They hired me as CTO last February, in their first-round of VC funding, and my salary tripled when I signed. They offered me thousands of stock options. Why would I say no to that? With my signing bonus, I bought a new porcelain-white Beamhoffer sedan for the longer commute.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a new era. Just six months before that, we’d gone on a belated Honeymoon cruise. We’d both been working so much after college, so hard, constantly. Our actual honeymoon consisted of a trip to the Indiana Dunes and two steamy nights in a La Panoche Inn. It took awhile to plan something else. But we did. And it was worth it. Jenna had bought a mommy suit, a black one-piece. Perhaps it was subliminal anticipation of something new. This one had way more coverage than the spring break two-piece she had once worn in Cancún. And it had ruffles. The elastic made her skin bulge. I have to admit, my heart sank a little when I saw it for the first time. We were in our stateroom, getting ready to test the adult pool, and she had just stepped into its leg-holes and pulled it up over herself. I stared, speechless. She got uncomfortable, asked what I was looking at. I asked what happened to the bikini. She said she only wore it tanning now. I said: “So I never get to see you in it?”</p>

<p>She said: “No.”</p>

<p>That cruise was so face-meltingly good. It was a relief to be on vacation, and we reveled in it. Some people on cruises feel so far out of their element they don’t know what to do or say. Not us. We ate the buffet everyday, always took more food than we could eat, talked about Motomoto, talked about Arlensin, talked about the activities schedule and whether we should go to the singles Hoe-Down even though we weren’t singles, or whether we should do the Big Bandwagon Bingo Hour just for kicks, or whether the Old Prospector Tequila Tasting would be too rowdy. We went to the formal dinners, Jenna in a pinstriped business suit, stockingless, her bare calves and ankles and those sensible pumps as they negotiated the regular heave and drop of the floor causing me no end to lewd thoughts as I followed her to our regular table, raising a fever that caused me to overeat and overdrink and overthank our waiter Frank who was from Moldova, a place Jenna insisted was nearer to Warsaw than Moscow, as she brushed, with delicate bracelet, my insistent under-table hand from her knee. Later I would be too suppled in the gut area to think about her ankles and sensible pumps anymore, especially as she opened her blouse and stepped out of her lacy underwear and threatened to straddle me on the swollen bed.</p>

<p>“I’m a food tube,” I said. “You’re going to squish it back out of me.”</p>

<p>By the end of the week, out of pure, fulsome satiety, we were spending our meals in complete silence, staring out at endless water, yet eating even more to compensate for the lack of conversation, and still occasionally bantering, not bickering, about where Moldova was, whenever the topic of Frank came up. Out of boredom and a feeling that if I exercised I would have more regular bowel movements, I tried climbing the rock wall. At the very top, my feet and hands went numb, and the next thing I knew I was falling. I wasn’t too worried. In fact, as I fell, I didn’t feel afraid, I experienced a feeling of well-being. I was only twenty feet in the air and cabled up real good. This is fun, everyone has to fall once. I was probably even smiling. But because the smartass manning the gear didn’t clip something to something else, probably because he was too busy cracking inappropriate jokes about my climbing style, I fell the whole way. I landed ribs first on a plastic bucket.</p>

<p>That was the last day, the last dinner with Frank and the family from Iowa we’d been making small talk with all week. I started telling them the story of my rock-climbing accident but got interrupted just as I said “so I got to the top”—by Frank, who appeared tableside saying “Excuse me, friends, for you now I will sing top song in my country,” and started singing a farewell shanty about ice-fishing, partially in English, partly in some guttural language somewhere between French and Spanish, snapping his fingers in time as he bellowed, and making his way around the table, holding the hands of each of the women at the table as he sang. He kissed Jenna on the knuckle, and I swear I saw his tongue flick out between his fat kissing lips, undoubtedly to steal a lick of her salty body. “Frank,” I said, “Take it easy there. That’s my wife!” But no one heard me. Frank had thoroughly captured them with his hammy shenanigans. When he came around to me, he put a hand on my shoulder and began belting out what I hoped was the final verse. His breath smelled like the bull seal arena we saw on one of those island stops, and his teeth looked rotten. I flinched, and flinched even more when he finished the song by pointing at me, uttering some gobbledygook word, and laughing.</p>

<p>We went to our stateroom after dinner, Jenna in the hallway with a palm on each wall, balancing herself against the slosh of the sea and the bottle of wine she’d mostly consumed on her own. My ribcage throbbed. I had overeaten again, and it made it that much worse. I told Jenna as we opened the door that I’d broken a rib. She gave me an in-the-mood smile and then also flashed it to someone down the hall, waved at them, and just before I squeezed into the doorway behind her, I caught the two black African guys smiling and nodding as they folded towels with their long black fingers. </p>

<p>She turned on the TV, the classical music channel.</p>

<p>“Oh My God,” she said, rapturously, “They’re playing Smetana.”</p>

<p>“I think I broke a rib.”</p>

<p>“No, wait this is Dobrzynski. This is symphony number one!”</p>

<p>“Ow. Be careful.”</p>

<p>“This is our last night on this cruise.”</p>

<p>Her fingers were snaking their way up my shirt. I think I screamed. In the hallway, I’m sure, the Black Africans traded smiles.</p>

<p>She gaped at me. “I’m sorry. I didn’t realize—”</p>

<p>“It really hurts.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be gentle.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand. I don’t even think I can lie down.”</p>

<p>She said yeah, but she couldn’t stand it anymore. She helped me lie down despite my protests. She told me to talk to her with a Moldovan accent. She said she understood I was full, she understood my side hurt. She told me I didn’t have to move, didn’t have to waste any energy getting on top. She undid my pants, ran her fingernails over me. I did a poor impression of Frank. “My name ees Frank. Top sexy. I am coming from Moldova. Ees a small country.” She opened her shirt and stepped out of her skirt and, bracing herself with one hand on the back of the chair, squatted over me on the foot of the bed, and began to do things I’d never seen her do, gyrating her blossom all over me while rubbing it from the top with a free hand, a trick like the one I could never do where you pat your head while rubbing the belly, or vice-versa. She closed her eyes and threw her head back, forgetting I was there, without a condom, a rare experience that made me forget about my pain. It was tacitly approved, this once, I knew, and I knew this somehow cast all the ambiguous conversations about planning for a child to the winds of fate. This was no negotiated starter period, to be interrupted by withdrawal and unrolling the little sheath over a disappointed weasel. I wasn’t about to question it, not out loud at least. The deck heaved our little stateroom at the sky, then dropped from beneath it, like me tossing Ethan at the sun. Outside there was probably still a streak of pink across the horizon, pricked by trawler antennas. And above that clouds swirling into purple darkness. The classical music sounded very lo-fi but it rose with the sea itself, told me about the properties of water and its movements both massive and subtle. I looked at Jenna and felt nothing. She seemed to be using me in a way I didn’t even know she knew. No, this wasn’t her. That was the answer I came up with. Maybe this woman was thinking about Frank. Maybe the two African guys. Maybe she wasn’t thinking of anything. She was having her experience, and I was having mine, and it was wonderful. Contractions down there, slow then faster, locking me like a nipple in a breast pump. The waves strengthened with biological precision. Her body was pumping mine, harder and harder, squeezing out every drop it could. This had never happened, never before in our whole sexual history, not this kind of suction grip. All systems were go. And I went. We went, together.</p>

<p>She slowed her circular rubbing, lowered her chin from the ceiling, settled gently with eyes closed, then opened them and blinked once at me, almost in surprise, with a look on her face like she might ask how in the world I got there. Then she looked down there and said, “What just happened?”</p>

<p>“I finished.”</p>

<p>“You did it inside me?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, of course.”</p>

<p>She wrinkled her nose, lifted herself off, grabbed a fistful of tissues from the desk, started mopping.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, of course?” She glared at me.</p>

<p>“Well I assumed it was okay.”</p>

<p>“Why would you assume that?”</p>

<p>“Because you didn’t say anything about pulling out.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you would assume that. Oh, my god, I can feel it dripping out. It’s all over. You really got it inside. You know how I feel about this.”</p>

<p>“But you clearly didn’t want me to wear a condom,” I said, swallowing a lump in my throat. “Right?”</p>

<p>All the pain of my rib was coming back, and with it another pain. This other pain was in the back of my neck. It seemed to come either directly from my spinal cord or my brain itself. Worse than this was the flatness that the whole scene took on. Jenna was nothing more than a paper cutout, the stateroom a backdrop. The color had drained from everything, and the music whined like it had soiled its diapers. I was seeing starfish patterns in the air, overlaid on her face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, frowning. “I wanted it that way. But I didn’t want you to ejaculate.”</p>

<p>“With the way you were working on it? Everything you were doing was designed to make me. You were like an expert.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. It just seemed like we had an unspoken agreement.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to take a mile when I give you a few millimeters.”</p>

<p>“Am I supposed to read your mind?”</p>

<p>“No, just don’t be so selfish.”</p>

<p>“I think I broke a rib on that bucket.”</p>

<p>She wasn’t listening. She had a wet washcloth now, and was wiping herself the way someone would swab an ear canal.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to worry about,” I told her. “You were bolt upright. Sometimes gravity is good contraception too.”</p>

<p>Well. Accidents happen. And they can sometimes be miraculously engineered. In no time, we knew our little family of two was about to grow. That belated cruise was truly a gift that would keep giving.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Life is full of surprises. Some of them, like drunken hobos crossing a fine motorway, can be avoided or run down, if you can tolerate the bumps. Others are truly special: like double rainbows in the valley, or waterfalls coming out of waterfalls. Either way, the unexpected requires some adjustments, and what counts ultimately are the expectations. You know where you’re going, and you know you’re going to arrive there eventually.</p>

<p>We never had any official discussions about raising a child, but we didn’t need to. We both knew it was just an unspoken expectation. She was hung up for a bit on that idea. That it had never been discussed. But ultimately, it didn’t need to be. I said, “What did you expect, to never have a child? To never be a mother, never be like your own mother?”</p>

<p>Of course, she denied any such expectation.</p>

<p>“So you expected the opposite,” I countered. “So what difference does it make if we had a conversation about it?” </p>

<p>Just over a month ago, on a bright fall afternoon, Jenna got the results of the blood test confirming the second big surprise. I was ecstatic.</p>

<p>“Not all surprises are good,” she said. I agreed with that. I allowed her that one, and commended her. I said, “You’re right, Jenna. Some surprises are bad. But I’d be surprised even more if you thought this one was bad.”</p>

<p>She was sitting how she sits when she’s waiting for me to finish talking, her knees together and her hands crossed over them, her back very straight, not looking at me. She looked beautiful, as always, her hair catching some of the white light from the living room window and the yard. She was not smiling. But she does have a perfect smile, very white, with dull, broad canines and no gums showing. It’s a smile that always lends the impression she’s holding something back. The cleft on her chin deepens when she thinks. Her ears, the very crests of them, twist out a bit, and I never noticed as much as I do now, with her maternally tapered hairstyle, that they set off the long muscles in her neck. And she does have a long neck, for someone with such a small head.</p>

<p>She is still very, very beautiful, and what I like most about her is that she’s a good accessorizer: silver, precious gems, things that tinkle and twinkle. It’s about maturity. Wisdom and wealth augment each other. Nothing gets me going like the thought of a well accessorized, petite woman in business casual. She wears a cubic-zirconia-studded gold bracelet I bought her for our fifth anniversary on sale at Z-less. She also has several complexly-set gold heirloom rings given to her by her grandmother, and of course the engagement ring and one-carat diamond wedding band I bought her at Jack’s Club way back when. I also purchased a gold waistchain for her two years ago, and she relishes wearing this, if I insist. She also wears tasteful pendant earrings and a thin gold necklace with a gold cross, both of which she purchased at Lazarette’s (with her own savings).</p>

<p>Of course, when I wanted to talk about names, she looked at me with raised eyebrows. “I don’t want to have the name conversation any time soon,” she said.</p>

<p>This was our new joy, I told her. It was a surprise, sure. A happy one. And the first thing we needed to do was talk about names. I reminded her gently that a name is the first credential for personhood. And what’s more, recall that on her insistence, we waited to name Ethan until after he was born. The outcome of that one? I compromised. And again when he was born: I compromised. She had seen an Ethan, I had seen a Todd. I went along with her preference. Now we had a new candidate on the way. And how could I resist throwing out some options? I told her if he’s a boy, I’d like to name him Tad. None of my suggestions went over well. In fact, it’s been difficult to discuss at all. This is something we’re working through. In the last month, I’ve been subjected to questions regarding trivial things I’d thought we’d buried in the past. Lists of my bad habits have very recently been enumerated on slim delectable fingers, usually no more than four, but always a different list, and always surprisingly exact, and surprisingly surprising. One Sunday at the Red Barn Pancake House I noticed streaks of eyeliner marring her cheeks after an abnormally long visit to the restroom.</p>

<p>“We’re not even going to look at the name books,” she said. “I don’t want to know if it’s a boy or girl, and I don’t care who’s predicting it. Whether it’s coming from a doctor or ultrasound or a string and needle, or someone’s opinion on my salt cravings or how much it kicks or Myrianna’s Chinese Lunar calendar.”</p>

<p>“A Chinese Lunar calendar,” I snorted. ”That would be an utterly stupid thing to pay any attention to anyway. Might as well read tea leaves or something.”</p>

<p>She put her hands against her temples. She seemed to be grinding her teeth. It takes fewer muscles to smile, I tell her from time to time. Did you know that? She said, “It was right about Ethan.” She was referring to the calendar, Myrianna’s Chinese Calendar. Enough about that. I frequently cite the original name compromise. Gently invoke it. Gentle reminders, pillow talk sometimes. I always do it in a loving way, to show I’m concerned about her feelings too. I like Brad quite a bit. They rhyme, Tad and Brad, and I think that&#8217;s nice. Then, I guess, Tip or Gary. Then Mark.</p>

<p>The last time I brought it up, a few weeks ago, she said simply, “I’m not taking part in this discussion,” and went back to reading, or pretending to, while she lay in bed.</p>

<p>“You can’t possibly keep reading while I’m listing off names,” I said, laughing in a playful way. It was funny. She kept pretending to read, in bed, an absurdly gigantic book about architecture. A book that was too large to read in bed and too large to be a book! There she was, tiny, with a giant book. About buildings! I listed some names I definitely did <em>not</em> want to name our new joy: Adrian, Oliver, Francis, Damien or Damon, Lawrence or Larry, Milton, Darius, Balin or Brandt, Sherman, Warren, Chester, Jordan, Neville or Ned, Julian, Sergio, Rudolph, Roderick, Hubie, Gabriel, Zachary or Monty or Antonio. I told her that I wouldn’t even in a deranged state of mind name a son Renaldo. And then I started to get angry. It actually took me by surprise, that anger, because normally I’m very calm. Clearly, I’m not the kind of guy who foams at the mouth and rants and raves whenever he finds something disagreeable.</p>

<p>I had been sort of moving around the room, doing my normal before-bed-routine—putting things in their place, wallet and keys and Moto on the dresser, shirt and tie hung nicely on the back of the bathroom door, underwear neatly laid out on the heirloom rocking chair with a rolled pair of ToeClad polyblend socks placed gently on top of them—and suddenly I turned to face her. I told her that by the way, Ethan would have been the last damn name I really wanted to name my son, and I reminded her I only consented to it during a protracted two-day crying fit—one in which she told me her life was worthless and she would rather die than raise a child—only consented because of her repeated lament that he deserved a name that didn’t make him seem like the accident he was. There you go. And that was a plea that got to me; not because I really believed he was—as she insisted on putting it—an accident, or because I myself believed that, or even because I thought the name Ethan fit that bill, but because out of love I thought it really would be the one thing that would make her feel better about her life. I told her not unkindly that I was in no way done with the discussion, even if she was. I told her we would talk about this again, and if I had to, I’d talk to the doctor. I told her I’d make diggy dawg sure this time that Doctor Mashay, and not Myrianna with her frickin calendar, would be the one to tell me it’s a boy.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I appreciate the kind of shared knowing silence that happens between colleagues. I would love to say that even Renaldo and I can bond in this time of crisis. That our silence is a comforting whisper uniting two opposing pugilists in solidarity after a well-matched struggle in the ring. That we sit in calm mutual respect amidst the furor of the arena. I would love to say that, about this. It would be nice. But it’s not the case. This is getting uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I better call my wife,” I say, unsnapping my phone holster. I finger my Moto’s buttons without pressing any. I don’t want Renaldo eavesdropping on true intimacy.</p>

<p>I swivel around and stand up. If she answers, then out with it. Get it out of the way up front. She may not care. No, that’s not true. She’ll care. But her questions won’t be the right questions.</p>

<p>Might as well survey the scene before I go make the call.</p>

<p>Two long rows of small laquered woodlike tables, arranged along a carpeted area in front of a wood-paneled partition. No ketchup in sight. The bar menu is squarely German Hobo Carnival fare and everyone knows that’s mustard only. Partly visible on the other side of the bar partition is the full restaurant, with tablecloths and everything, a big area with the kind of full dining experience you’d expect if you’re just stumbling in from whatever business you have in the Loop. Buffet rooms at the back for large parties. Roast suckling pig a specialty, as is well-aged sauerbraten in red cabbage sauce. Take your cronies there, suck on marrow. Big politicos in the Daley machine sometimes seen. Me, I prefer the bar. From the bar, you can still see the stage, but you don’t pay the cover charge or the inflated menu prices. Right now, in fact, I can see some bozos up there, tweaking mike stands and opening big cases for what might turn out to be a semi-decent smooth jazz jam sesh.</p>

<p>I head right, toward an old-timey poster on a wainscotted wall showing a giant hand below the words YE OLDE EXIT. I squeeze past a few plants and situate myself near the entrance, close but not too close to the ten-foot tall fiberglass clown.</p>

<p>According to the display on my mobile unit, it’s 2:43, and outside it’s still raining. People are coming in for the pending happy hour, shoulders breathing vapor, gloved hands shaking umbrellas at the ground. A guy holds the door for a knockout redhead in knee-high boots and leather trenchcoat. They could be coworkers. She’s made up, he’s rosy and clean-shaven. He steps carefully to maintain a certain distance from her. She looks at him with that conference room trapeze-artist glance, the What’s-Our-Next-Move look, or, I’m All Ears. It’s not a soft look, and in his acknowledging glance there’s neither the glazed look of domestic routine nor dating angst. He helps her off with her coat. She smiles. Whatever’s unspoken between them, they both still have jobs.</p>

<p>No, I don’t think I’ll call her yet. Better to wait a little bit. No need to alarm her if something miraculous comes through and things are somehow reversed. I snap my Moto into its holster and return to the bar.</p>

<p>Julia is staring into the smoke-filled air as she shakes a cocktail. On the TV there’s a Japanese helmet scooping up blue water that drains from a bullet hole. Our company didn’t deserve this. We had good products and good relationships. We had enthusiastic investors, until the last weeks. We came this close to launching. Our flagship product, Der SwarfTagger, was our hope for big licensing, from heavy hitter media companies like Phonia, Mallsoft Systems Labs, Pan Tang Digital Industries, and even, with my extensive connections there, the behemoth portable maker itself, looking to leverage its hardware in the too-hot-to-handle media distribution market: Motomoto. It’s true: I was a key player in all this. I did all the class modeling for Der SwarfTagger, and I did the developmental oversight for the TMR, or Tokenizing Media Spindle, which is the ingenious little application meant to self-install on the end user’s machine and hide itself in the kernel stack whenever they first cue up a SwarfTagged disc. In fact, the whole concept of Media Tokens being the result of spindle knockouts was my innovation. And people liked it. People really liked it. Everyone in the company was jazzed about the notion that Media Tokens could spawn new Tokenizing Spindles, which would hide themselves in the kernel in different hard-to-detect ways. I came up with that. Torvin told me, with tears of joy glistening at the rims of his eyes, that his investment in my skillset had really paid off, whether we made it or not. He paused in his praise only to sneeze, then said: “Really, really phenomenal work. At this point, I’m learning from you, Chad!” Of course I was humble. And gracious, in light of this praise. “Just thank the guy that came up with the turntable,” I told him, “And the coin-operated jukebox. I didn’t invent these concepts, I’m just applying them in a novel way. That’s my job.”</p>

<p>Or: <em>was</em> my job.</p>

<p>For this last milestone, we had a full authoring suite slated for production. The SwarfTagger was working like a charm. And the Media Spindle library was finely tuned, and ready to go as soon as anyone could figure out Renaldo’s screwy new build system. It seemed we were all destined for the cover of QuickieStart Weekly or Dealmakers 2.0. Interviews with BeezNet, first-class flights to Seattle. I would have bought Jenna something new, something really expensive. And for Ethan, everything an infant needs. But it was not so. Ah, if it could have been.</p>

<p>Well, there’s no use lamenting it. It was a dream job, that’s for sure. I don’t think I could have asked for anything better. I had nothing to complain about. Especially with the Beamer. The whole thing, that car, is a marvel of engineering. As I developed the Der SwarfTagger and the Tokenizing Media Spindle, I held the perfect harmony of that car’s parts in my mind as an impossible standard. Everything in the interior of that vehicle, I thought, was geared toward my personal comfort. It aspired to nothing less than the pinnacle of ergonomics. That machine sealed out traffic noise like a coffin—one of the expensive upholstered ones, not the cheap kind that Jenna’s grandfather was laid to rest in. The Germans! They’ve always known how to make their guests comfortable; Schaumburg itself was founded by old Germans. The Beamer is part of a grand legacy of comfort and efficiency. And, as far as I’m concerned, so was Der SwarfTagger. Whenever we have meetings about User Interface guidelines, I use the Beamer as an example to our coders. “There is nothing like German engineering,” I tell them. I have a little rehearsed pep talk about German engineering that goes a bit like this: “These Heinrichs and Von Brotheimers they are so frickin good at reducing the margins of error. In any system it’s the human factor that makes for failure, but those German dynamos, they reduce it to something negligible. That way, the interface masters the user, not the other way around. When someone at Phonia pops open the SwarfTagger, I want craven interaction. I want them to want to obey. And most importantly, I want no question about whose comfort is at stake here. Stop thinking of an application’s interface as a humble servant and start conceiving of it as a specialized police state. The Germans knew how to organize their towns and police states as well as they know how to pack an engine or surround a driver: let’s do the same for our users.”</p>

<p>And everything was humming along at a fine clip, effortlessly, it seemed, until that last milestone. As it came up on our roadmap, new complications arose. One day it became a crisis, just like that. The question I faced on that desperate afternoon was: “So, Chad, when do you think we can roll a release?”</p>

<p>Torvin Reynolds, the one who asked, is a good guy, very clean-cut, with clear blue eyes that make his pupils look like dark seeds. I liked Torvin, liked him from day one. I felt confident with him steering the company. But it was always my job to shield my team from impractical deadline demands. He knew this, of course. So finally he told me to cut the crapola. “We’re getting some waffling from Dirk and Barry,” he said.</p>

<p>Dirk and Barry were two of our biggest VCs, and they were no novices in the Order of the Startup. Before NDC, Dirk had pioneered the use of those ads that slide across the content of web pages, forcing the user to click them away—or better yet, accidentally click through them—and was also responsible for funding the company that made Dancing Ads—the ones that evasively reel and jig around the page, buying ever more precious view time for the advertiser. Barry made his name on StealthWAD, a clicktracker that aggregates user browsing data into CoreWADS (COnsumer REsearch Wide Area Distribution Sets). His windfall came in a class action: the judge found precedent in other cases of the binding nature of user agreements, and the nature and purpose of StealthWAD, the user agreement clearly stated, was to provide competitive consumer discounts in exchange for participation in market data aggregation. To allow the software to install, even from the browser, all users had to agree to its terms. Barry was no dim bulb. He had foreseen this from the start, integrated it into his business plan. StealthWAD 1.0 continued to feed data to his business partners long after the users had given up on figuring out how to uninstall it. And the kicker was this: Barry managed to turn a court reprimand, a directive that StealthWAD 1.0 could no longer be installed through web pages or browser controls, into a brilliant new strategy. StealthWAD 2.0 only got distributed bundled up with other software packages, and its installation was always last, meaning that even if the user actually read licensing agreements, by the time they had clicked through separate agreements for the other apps in the bundle, they would be too impatient to even glance at the agreement for StealthWAD 2.0. Barry was no slouch. Dirk had cashed in on an idea, but Barry had engineered relentless profit. He might just be a genius, and if he was waffling on this, I would have to listen. And I listened. I listened to Torvin explain that Barry, and Dirk, and even a few of the others, were having doubts that the venture would be worth continuing without Mallsoft Systems Labs on board. Mallsoft Systems was the strategic key to the business plan. It was not essential—there were some contingencies built in—but we all knew it was far more crucial than any of the others, including Phonia and my former cash cow, Motomoto. Now, word was Mallsoft Systems had been courting our top competition, a company out in Palo Alto called NovaPrint, and they were well past the formalities. The kimono was open. They were now, as Torvin not-so-cryptically put it, “Moving on to the pinky banging.” I wasn’t sure that pinky-banging had to technically come after the kimono was open, but for Torvin, it apparently did. This was not good news for anyone. Especially the engineers. Rolling a release before we were ready would mean releasing an inferior product, which could shut the company down anyway. Enough time was needed for QA and bugfixes. I tried explaining that not all of the features had been implemented, but he interrupted. “Cut any feature that’s not alive now,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then you’re talking about the authoring GUI.”</p>

<p>“Not the whole thing. Just any feature of it without a pulse.”</p>

<p>“But key features would get cut,” I said.</p>

<p>“How key?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Very key. The whole look-and-feel of the thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have a week. Finish the codec revisions. As for the version one GUI, just take it out of the spec completely. Do something faceless. Just the stamps and the nubs.”</p>

<p>“You mean the stumps and the nibs,” I said, putting a finer point on it, my specialty.</p>

<p>“Whatever. Just the basics. All we need there is the ability to demonstrate the swarf tagging and the tokenization.”</p>

<p>“You mean the perforation.”</p>

<p>“Whatever you’re calling it. Just forget about the spec, forget about the nomenclature, get something ready.”</p>

<p>I reminded him that it was not an inexact science. He told me this time it had to be. I bristled. We went around like this for awhile, quibbling. In the end there was nothing good to be done. He insisted that Mallsoft Systems would not wait beyond next Friday, and Dirk and Barry were even more anxious than that. As soon as the second round was gone, Torvin said, they were going to bolt. There would be no third round of funding unless Mallsoft Systems signed on. This wasn’t their original intention, but it was now.</p>

<p>Torvin said, “As long as its clean, as long as it shows progress, we’ll be fine.”</p>

<p>Within a week Mallsoft Systems bought Novaprint and Barry and Dirk and Roger and the rest of them said they were backing out. Everyone in the company was pinkslipped. The remaining team would be given substantial bonuses with what remained of the salary budget. The only salvation for the rest of the operation was to auction off the IP—the intellectual property, all our lines of code—which if we were lucky, would get the board somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>They had already put in seventeen million.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>As it turns out I don’t have to call Jenna at all—she’s calling me. My ring tone sounds, and I let it, for Renaldo’s sake. Let Renaldo hear some real music for once, a catchy phrase or two from Voss Frisswagon’s smooth jazz top 100 hit, Moon Dabbler #9. Let him file that away in his taste profile.</p>

<p>I take it by the front doors. My wife and I exchange casual, affectionate greetings, as per usual. It’s a great comfort to have a life partner. To enjoy that shared trust. The mutual affection. The serene faith in each other. When we greet, it’s as if nothing is wrong at all. And it’s not. It’s easy to believe, right now, in the first cool washes of the coming wave of holiday cheer, with our new home and our new child, that everything will be okay. That there’s no cause for alarm. Even if the NDC position has come to an end. Even if on this Friday, I’m faced not only with breaking the news to her, but readying myself for the next career move. The weight of fatherhood is a welcome burden. And the obligations of family are a privilege. Jenna and I understand this. Despite everything else that’s happened, we understand.</p>

<p>I think for a moment that the sheer goodwill of marital congeniality could soften the news, perhaps, and perhaps now is a good time after all. So I say, “Well, some developments over here, today. This afternoon. Interesting news here. Interesting.” </p>

<p>But actually the news I have is not that interesting. I want it to be, but it’s not at all. Plus, it’s just not the kind of thing that’s appropriate for a Friday afternoon. So instead, I just tell her the facts: I’m down at the Wunder Bar on LaSalle with Renaldo; I’m just having a few drinks and then coming home early.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she says. “You’re with Renaldo?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, we’re just having a long lunch.”</p>

<p>“But you hate Renaldo.”</p>

<p>“Well, hate is a strong word.”</p>

<p>“You’ve said it to me a dozen times. You’ve said: I hate Renaldo. When we went to Imbroglio’s, you wouldn’t talk about anything else.”</p>

<p>Imbroglio’s: the anniversary dinner last summer. It was shortly after Renaldo had been hired without my approval. I wouldn’t have been talking about it had the waiter, with his ponytail and goatee and stooped shoulders, looked a little less like Renaldo.</p>

<p>“All you would talk about that night was how mad you were they hired him, and how you hated his being so popular.”</p>

<p>“I never said he was that popular.”</p>

<p>“Uh, you said: He wouldn’t be so popular if it weren’t for his name. You said: Why didn’t his parents name him something else? You said: Don’t they know Renaldo is a black guy’s name?”</p>

<p>“I did not say that.”</p>

<p>Past the partition and down the bar, Renaldo is moving his hands through the air voluptuously as if they’re already on the bartender’s body. A hopeless case. And her, doomed to a series of relationships with men incapable of even sustaining themselves. She leans over her elbows on the bar, smiling. Her face and bare arms look as dark as the finished wood beneath them. Her hands are clasped. Renaldo’s skin is yellowed like old wallpaper. He wobbles his head around, eyes closed, smacks the air, caresses it. She laughs. From this distance, his slouch and fat gut are even more obvious. With his obnoxious ragged army-surplus backpack lying near his feet, he could be mistaken for a homeless man. How could Torvin and Tony have ever hired him?</p>

<p>Jenna is still talking. “Did you hear what I said?”</p>

<p>“What? I’m getting bad reception here.”</p>

<p>“Who else is there?”</p>

<p>“Just us.”</p>

<p>“So when will you be home?”</p>

<p>“In a few hours, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Chad?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m getting fat.”</p>

<p>“You are?”</p>

<p>“I’m standing in front of the bedroom mirror, and I’m naked. I can see all the fat.”</p>

<p>“Jenna, you’re not—”</p>

<p>A man who has just come in the door is staring me right in the face.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” I say.</p>

<p>He’s in a suit. I have to give him credit: you can never underestimate the impact of a tasteful suit. His hair is white, his eyes wide and blue, his mouth set between dignified lines. There are white hairs peeking out of his pink nostrils. He doesn’t say excuse me, just stares at me. I move out of his way, bumping Struggles the Clown, whose large hand I feel molest my back. I shuffle a bit, turn, look up at Struggles, ten-foot tall, laminated fiberglass, his chin jutting and body clawed in a kind of old-time Dick Butkus stance, ready to tackle, one eye open, one eye closed, hard to tell if he’s winking or if he’s just got some grit in his eye. In one hand he’s holding a huge empty cup and in his other hand what looks like a brownbag cocktail but the menus say is a bag of beans.</p>

<p>I crouch close to Struggles’ body and lower my voice: “I can’t really talk about personal issues here. It’s embarrassing. Okay?”</p>

<p>There are mirrored panels, about three feet by two feet, on either side of the entryway, and in the closest one I’m surprised to see how much I’m hunching. My hands are sealed over my ears, like a man taking cover from an explosion.</p>

<p>“I was telling Myrianna I feel like veal.”</p>

<p>I hunch over more. “Veal? I’m okay with veal tonight. Did you go to the store?”</p>

<p>“No, I feel penned up, trapped. I’m talking about what to do about this whole—”</p>

<p>A black couple comes in. The woman, in a pea coat, with that ironed-down June Cleaver hair that black ladies sometimes have, removing gloves and closing her umbrella, the man turning down the collar of his trenchcoat with meaty hands. They stare at me, both of them, as if I’m somehow impinging on their space, although really in the mirror it appears I’m huddled as close to a giant laminated clown as I can be without actually humping it. The man with a light hand on the woman’s coat guides her in front, a nice, high, rounded, bare forehead, sparsely pimpled cheeks, and a stark jawline trailing claustrophobia-inducing perfume. The man passes, a baby-cheeked, brown-sugary head and dark eye looking at me sideways.</p>

<p>“Well, how much have you gained?”</p>

<p>“I’ve gained a pound. And I can see it.”</p>

<p>“You can discern one pound of fat spread all over your body? That’s like a millimeter of thickness or less.”</p>

<p>“It’s in my breasts and hips.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>“I dont think you understand what I&#8217;m trying to tell you. We need to talk. Tonight. Okay? I’ve been thinking a lot.”</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something unusual in the tone of her voice. A different kind of stress.</p>

<p>”Why? Thinking about what?”</p>

<p>”I&#8217;ll tell you about it when you get home.”</p>

<p>”Tell me now.”</p>

<p>”No, Chad, it&#8217;s just not the kind of thing we can talk about on the phone, okay?”</p>

<p>”Why not? You say something, I listen. I say something, you listen. What&#8217;s the big diff?”</p>

<p>A police officer is staring me in the eye as he edges past.</p>

<p>“Eastbound on North Ave at a high rate of speed.”</p>

<p>I cover the phone. “Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“Not talking to you,” he says.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I say. “Sorry. I thought you were kind of looking at me while you said something.” But he’s already moved past.</p>

<p>Jenna’s voice: “What did you say?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>

<p>She starts talking rapidly at a higher volume, and I&#8217;m certain her voice can be heard outside the vicinity of my head, which is embarrassing. She’s been doing this, lately. I am sure it’s nothing to worry about. One day, for example, she called me to matter-of-factly say she’d thrown up on Ethan’s head. The way she put it was “Right on his little soft spot.” I laughed, but it was no joke. It happened at the mall, apparently. She and Myrianna were standing at the Pizella’s Pizza and Myrianna was talking about greasy sausage, and Jenna said it just took her by surprise. She said she tried to keep it all in her mouth, but it just kind of spilled out anyway, down her chest and onto Ethan’s head. Ethan didn’t seem to mind, but Myrianna was horrified. Myrianna kept saying oh my god oh my god, and handing her napkins. I found that out by asking a lot of questions about Myrianna’s reaction.</p>

<p>Another cop enters through the front doors, his winter jacket covered in tiny droplets.</p>

<p>Jenna is still talking.</p>

<p>”Okay,” I say, finally. “Don’t throw a hissy. Thoughts and feelings convo at oh-five-hundred tonight.”</p>

<p>As the second cop passes I repeat: “Oh-five-hundred.”</p>

<p>He blinks at me.</p>

<p>Renaldo got hired in the summer. He made it, amazingly, through two interviews, and had one more scheduled, with me. I had already gotten an array of positives from Tony (our senior build engineer) and two of the senior developers, but I hadn’t actually given the go-ahead, and I didn’t have to until I’d interviewed him myself, so there was no rush. I knew they liked him, but I got enough of a glimpse of him on the day he interviewed with Tony to know he wasn’t the right person. And I certainly wouldn’t have taken that Monday morning, the day of my scheduled interview, as a sick day, had I not been kneeling in front of a toilet in a La Panoche Inn bathroom, throwing up gouts of golden liquid.</p>

<p>But that’s another story.</p>

<p>Point is, there was no way that my taking a sick day should have forfeited my veto power, but when I arrived the next day, at 8:15 AM, Renaldo was sitting there, not waiting to interview with me, but at a desk, as a new hire!</p>

<p>The gracious thing would have been to welcome him. Maybe even pull him into a conference room. Tell him I was sorry I didn’t get to interview him, and heck, slap of the knee, why not tell me a little something about himself? But I couldn’t even look at him because he had gotten there before me.</p>

<p>After I got over the shock, I went over to the desk, addressed Tony, who was sitting with Renaldo showing him the dev tools and the server scripts.</p>

<p>“Hey,” I said.</p>

<p>Tony saluted. I thought I caught him casting a telling wink at Renaldo, but it could have been a twitch. “Hey, Chad, what’s up?”</p>

<p>“So, uh, looks like you guys are here early.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, now that we’re on this secondary push, I’m pretty busy.”</p>

<p>“I see you have some help now,” I said, tilting my head toward the new guy. “Good, now maybe we can push the schedule forward.”</p>

<p>“Uh, I don’t know about that, but yeah, I do have some help,” he said, and began nodding enthusiastically at Renaldo. “Chad,” he said. “This is Renaldo. I know you didn’t get a chance to meet him.”</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Renaldo extended a hand.</p>

<p>“I did not get a chance.”</p>

<p>In a conference room, I had it out with Tony. I raised my voice fairly high. He insisted on how much everyone liked Renaldo and how qualified he was because he’d actually been working at SolaX for the last few years, managing builds on their J-colon releases. He’d gone to Stanford and he was a certified SolaX engineer. He made funny jokes and he had a lot of savior faire. He used that phrase, a Renaldo phrase, ripe with bohemianism. He also used the word pizazz.</p>

<p>“Remember?” Tony said, “I told you this stuff. You said he sounded like a real asset as long as he didn’t want more than sixty a year.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’d only seen him on paper,” I said. “I didn’t think we were discussing this guy. He’s a freak.”</p>

<p>“He’s actually pretty brilliant,” Tony said.</p>

<p>I laughed. “That’s an extreme compliment,” I said.</p>

<p>Tony shook his head.</p>

<p>I said, “We’ll see.”</p>

<p>Renaldo didn’t look like someone who could be counted on. First, there was the backpack. Everywhere he went he wore an army surplus backpack with things hanging from it. Attached to its straps by lengths of twine: A toothbrush, a comb, an empty one-liter Peregrino bottle (glass!). He wore the stupid contraption backwards, so the whole apparatus hung from him like a giant fat belly. He walked into work like that every day. It’s not a backpack, I thought, when I first saw it, it’s a frontpack, and I sniggered at the thought. He even wore his frontpack to the initial interview. I spied him being led around the office, frontpack sagging off him like a belly, comb and toothbrush dangling, green bottle swinging and tossing around monitor-light. A glass bottle. He would use this bottle throughout the day, filling it at the cooler, and if you happened to be waiting there when he was filling it, you had to wait a while. One day he let Theresa cut in front of him. He was about 350 ml in and he stopped, allowed her to fill her XT-Dicks mug. He smiled, she smiled, they chatted, she gave him many friendly looks that she never gave me. I started calling him Sir Renaldo, to myself. Knight of the Horndog Table. Theresa is the only female engineer and I could see where her piercings and tattoos and too-oft-exposed navel would excite a guy like Renaldo &#8230; but then I saw him grant the same favor to Tony. So, I thought: He’s not Sir Renaldo the Horny, he’s Kissass the Bold. I theorized he was doing it for every one of his higher-ups but me. I tested this one day, and sure enough, when he saw me standing impatiently behind him, he gave me a very cursory glance and said, “Hey Chad, almost done, hang in there, homes” &#8230; I went back to my desk without waiting, just to see if he could take a hint. I thought he might call over to me when he finished, let me know it was available, but he didn’t even look in my direction. He just moseyed back over to his desk, joking with Tony as he sat down.</p>

<p>He looked like someone who might disappear one day and call us from Amsterdam to tell us he had to “ramble on” cause he was a born drifter and his chi was out of whack. He had an unwashed ponytail and a ripe European odor that shrunk the elevator. He looked like exactly the kind of goon who trafficked in bootleg music and warez, not the kind of person we wanted working on copy protection.</p>

<p>I verified this one day when I discovered he’d put about 10 gigs of music on one of our Linux boxes, Kryton. It was being shared with the whole office network. When I raised the issue with Torvin, I got major pushback. “As long as the stuff stays in the office,” Torvin said, “I don’t see a problem with it.” We were in a conference room. I said, “But people will be copying that stuff and taking it home for their own collections,” and Torvin got the look he reserves for me when I’m being what he calls—and he only called me it once—a tightass. “It’s just not worth policing,” he said. “People have to be able to enjoy themselves at work.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” I said. And I threw my US Chipware squeezeball into the beanbag and walked out. And on the way out, I saw Renaldo, telling some funy story to Theresa. He had just come back from lunch and he was wearing a purple scarf. His fashion sense was worse than an immigrant’s. For his initial interview with Tony, walking into the reception area, he wore drab slacks with red piping down the sides of each leg and a collared short-sleeved marching band shirt. It looked ridiculous, like some kind of Slovakian train conductor’s uniform. At my desk, I snorted loudly to subtly project disdain, but the others didn’t seem to be observing him. He wore that outfit, or some slight variation of it, every other day at NDC. Maybe I hated it more than the frontpack, but at least I adjusted to it. I never got used to the frontpack.</p>

<p>“I like your frontpack,” I said, the week after he started. He went: “Huh?” I pointed at the frontpack, which lay on its side under the desk, its twiny things hanging around like limp tentacles. He looked at it, his face blank; then he grinned. “Oh, yeah. Frontpack! Right!” He pointed at me, his wrist so relaxed his hand wobbled. His index finger had blue and green string wrapped around it.</p>

<p>It was amazing the way I kept discovered details that made me hate him more.</p>

<p>I asked him later, “Hey Renaldo, why do you have that string on your finger?”</p>

<p>He said: “Superstition.”</p>

<p>And now this.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>When I return to the bar, Renaldo is still at it. Now he’s telling some surfing story and his arms are stretched out and waving around like he’s riding his stool down a gnarly tube and Julia the South African who sounds Australian is holding her face and hooting with a kind of laugh I’ve never heard before on a woman or man or any other creature on this planet. I sit down two stools away from him to avoid being swatted, and knock on the bar to get her attention. It takes several knocks. Finally, she comes over, eyeing me as if I’m just another distracting patron and not the temporary drinking companion of the big sad entertainer she’s hooting at. I tell her I’ll have another Xtra Light. Without acknowledging me, she moves over to the tap, pulling out a frosted glass and beaming at Renaldo as he finishes with a flourish, going: “Rude Dude, Rude Dude!”</p>

<p>Their conversation is unbearable. I deliberately tune out. You just don’t know. You just don’t understand, do you, Renaldo? You haven’t figured anything out. All these things you despise—rules, authority figures, institutions like marriage and insurance, Mallsoft Systems Labs, digital rights management—all these things you think hold you back—all these things are advantages. There’s a reason for them, and that reason is reason itself. From reason, we make more reasons. From logic, more logic. From law, more law. From control, more control. These are good things! But you will never accept this truth. Instead, you will grow facial hair that makes you look like a barnyard animal, you will cultivate an agricultural odor by refusing to wear deoderant or take showers. You will choose to shun your superiors instead of befriending them, and you prefer to steal your music instead of pay for it. You have your own code of ethics—as if ethics are made from macramé. Oh! Maybe you can just download a new pattern from that free website, use that pirated software program to modify it to suit your tastes, and then just fashion yourself a little ethics statement, an ethical frontpack perhaps, replete with a string for your Peregrino bottle. And you’ll walk around like that, goat-headed, making bad choices just because you can. And you can talk, to any jagoff with time to waste, about freedom and individualism and personal expression and creativity, but deep down you must be able to see, to understand, when you look at people all around you being successful, that true freedom is a carefully wrought, intricately designed, constantly innovated, extremely complex feat of engineering! It is not macramé! It is roads and bridges, safe new subdivisions, discount items at convenient locations, 30-minute oil changes, Jack’s Club, Deucey’s and Deucey’s Plus outlets, dealer direct financing and extra trim packages, PPOs and IPOs, enhanced interrogation techniques and five percent cash back on credit purchases, and policemen, firemen, FEMA and Customs, pants with StainGuard nano-cleanse technology and limited liability corporations and variety packs in handy sizes—and forty-year mortgages, flights of dipping sauces and index funds and REITs, and digital cable, DVRs and fiber to the curb, and thirty flavors of maple syrup at Red Barn Pancake House and the 1985 Bears Defensive Lineup, and the Wednesday-night SmorgaSack take-home allowance at Smorga’s Boardhouse Buffet, and free ring tones and sanitary toilet seat covers and itemized deductions and disposable digital cameras and Airpoints on every purchase and peace and prosperity and shock and awe. And all these meticulously designed webs of filament perpetuate the need to make new ones. And if you don’t believe that, Renaldo, if somewhere deep beneath that frontpack, you don’t feel that, feel it like the resonance of a bodily function, then you would’ve never gotten into software engineering, or any engineering, or anything, at all. You wouldn’t even exist.</p>

<p>But who am I kidding? I know all this. I’m telling it to myself. Renaldo lives in a macramé world. And look where it’s gotten him.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Tables in the bar area seem to be gradually filling up. Some tourists, a family, obviously European, judging by the multicolored shoes, feathered hats, and the way a few of them stare into the middle distance with open mouths. Then from the front entry, being led by a sour-faced boy in a Wunder Bar shirt, the two cops I saw. How did I beat them back here? Now they’re led past the barstools, and as they squeeze between me and the two confused-looking Asian line cooks who’ve been standing here discussing buffalo wing supplies, I give them both a constrained flyboy salute.</p>

<p>The fat officer says to the other, “The gaylord who jacked it was obviously a failure, even when it came to doing crimes.”</p>

<p>And the fatter one replies: “Let me get over there to trash talk the guy and tweak his nose through the sack on his head. Send the pictures to his family.”</p>

<p>Then they both laugh. I laugh too. It’s good to know they’re here. Good to have them around. Never mind that the size of their backsides indicates they enjoy apprehending good German fare more than wayward criminals. Look at the business they’re all about busying themselves with: their little radios scritch and blurp and their hands seem to move restlessly between various utility items on their belts. When their hands aren’t fidding with the pepper spray holsters or the radio clips, they’re twitching in the air haunch-close, ready to put their pro marksmanship to use if necessary.</p>

<p>The two guys with black aprons are still standing looking lost. I grin at them. “Looking for the kitchen guys?”</p>

<p>One of them looks, the other doesn’t. The one who looks says, “Can you read this?” and shows three fingers with scarred-up knuckles for me to look at.</p>

<p>“What is it, Japanese? Katakana, Hiragana, Kanji?”</p>

<p>“You a smart ass.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure your manager would like to know you said that about a paying customer.”</p>

<p>Then the other guy tugs his arm and they walk away toward the back.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>R and D is all about foresight. Technical foresight. It’s about putting your finger on the pulse of the future. Torvin knew from the beginning that the future of Digital Rights Management was in Total Solutions. Under my supervision at NDC, we prototyped a killer app that would digitally protect copyrighted media files. It was phenomenally advanced. It was nearly ready. But it should have come as no surprise that I pushed for quality right up until today. Why give the world something less than perfect?</p>

<p>Case in point: what I did at Motomoto. I was highly respected there for my extremely thorough nature. I started my career with a typical workplace role, respected as a member of a cutting-edge, pro-active team, seen as an equal by fellow employees. I moved up. As my ideas took hold, I began to notice a kind of quiet reverence whenever I entered a meeeting room. Members of my team averted their gaze when I came into their presence. Others nodded respectfully, afraid to say hello. At first, I didn’t know how to take it. I tried to make jokes about the silence. I tried to poke fun at their facial expressions. “Don, you look like you swallowed a turd today.” “Marie, are you pregnant, or did you eat some bad oatmeal this morning?” “Carlos, are you having sinus trouble, or imitating a howler monkey?” No matter how funny my quips were, the silence clung to my little team of innovators, embraced them in a group hug, like a second boss, one more powerful than I was. This, even though I told them not to think of me as a boss. “Think of me as a neutral buddy,” I said. “A guy that tells you how the apes rape. Not a guy that’s ever going to smooth things over for you, not a bakery buddy with a big tube of sugar coating, and not a rainmaker either—not a guy whose going to dump a bucket of water over you every time your idea bulbs light up start an electrical fire and all that. Not that guy either, just a guy whose going to tell you how the apes rape.”</p>

<p>And apes do rape. It’s a known fact about them, but one that people sometimes overlook, especially those doe-eyed types that Renaldo probably respects, who think that the animal world is somehow more noble than ours.</p>

<p>I respected the fact that Motomoto owned everything I ever designed. I told my team this repeatedly. “They own everything,” I said. “But you own the thing that makes the things that they own. And that’s up here.” And I would tap tap on my temple, giving them a winning smirk as I did so. “You own your brains,” I’d say. “The brains go: Take all you want, we’ll make more. Like that famous potato chip company, right?”</p>

<p>And so when I came up with Der Swarftagger and the Media Spindle for NDC, there was no infringement. In fact, what I gave NDC was a better designed, better engineered, completely different product suite with even more functionality than the aborted Motomoto CopyDaddy prototype I’d spearheaded. At Motomoto my big idea was to mod firmware on devices to track copies made. At that time, customized ringtones based on pirated MP3s were about to become ubiquitous, and we knew it before it happened. I got a fat promotion for that. And I didn’t stop there. You couldn’t just let any old schmoe make multiple copies of the latest Jassy Pamperton hit or Mandy Sassbottom remix, whenever they wanted to, without impunity. The next thought I had was: if people are going to be creating all these illegal copies of Pamperton and Sassbottom files, why can’t the firmware just act more like people—like police officers, for example, or parental authority figures? That was when I came up with a hardware abstraction layer: a virtual chip that could actually clone itself and identify with any data as a protector of that data; I called it the CopyDaddy Extraction Layer, and they all went ga-ga over it.</p>

<p>If I had simply replicated the CopyDaddy technology for NDC, it would have made my life easier, but it would have been wrong. And it would have been bad for business. And it would have left NDC with a bad product. Bad idea. Quality is important. They knew I believed that from day one of my employment. No matter what Torvin or Renaldo thought, I was right to try to delay the next release. And if I was negligent in any way, it was in not throwing my weight around enough. Letting Tony, and Renaldo, and even Torvin know who the Chief Technical Officer was, what he believed in. A person in authority’s role is authority. Together with Torvin, I’d helped come up with the company’s mission and core philosophy. I should have enforced the rules better. On the others, that is. My problem was trying to enforce them on myself.</p>

<p>After all, I was the one who came up with the Neutral Buddy Policy. I advised Torvin on what it should mean, how it should be phrased in the charter, and how it should be communicated to the crewmates and the swabbies. For example, I’m the smarty who pointed out the many connotations of the word neutral, emphasized that here it referred to one’s workplace disposition and not their level of interest or involvement. I said, “Torvin, our employee’s dispositions should be beige, but their interests should be hot pink.” He wasn’t too hot on pink, suggested maybe lava-orange, or inferno red, but he got the point. It meant level-headed, not detached and uninvolved. And even though I authored that policy, I allowed my disposition to be all over the complimentary-color spectrum and my interest to remain stuck in beige. I should have realized that in these final, dire weeks, I needed to be above the Neutral Buddy Policy. I needed to be forceful, sort of. The NBP stated that all the various pigments of bias were disallowed in the workplace. The goal of the NBP was total objectivity. My problem was that I kept trying to give Renaldo a fair shake, wanted him to see it as objectively as I did. Negativity on my part would have been considered poor conduct, even a violation of the employer-employee contract, in an extreme case like my true disposition toward Renaldo. Its dictum, posted in the kitchen and above the water coolers, was: “don’t lie, don’t cry, don’t pry, don’t sigh, don’t say die, don’t ask why and don’t over-try.” (I added the don’t over-try part after Renaldo was hired.) If all employees would just follow this dictum, the thinking went, NDC would be a well-oiled machine. No whiners allowed, it said. Renaldo: no whining about your co-workers, or your boss, especially to Tony, and especially not to Torvin. No sighing, no asking-why-ing. Got that now, Renaldo? &#8230; Sorry, too late. You should have just closed those bugs instead of trying to cut features and showing off your SolaX lameness to Tony.</p>

<p>I’ve been accused of having depressive tendencies, but only by Jenna, and anyway, depression is just a pet phrase for PWS — Pathetic Whiner Syndrome. Like I tell my developers: that awful feeling, it’s really just a tiny, unassuageable sick feeling in my belly, and I can completely ignore it, and so should you.</p>

<p>For my part, I never complain. I do sometimes object to behavior. But only when it’s subject to objection. Only if it offends my own modest, sensible preferences. I’m a fan of the Golden Rule. It always sounds archaic and high and mighty though. There’s nothing wrong with a more modern version of the golden rule, the titanium rule, that says: Expect others to do what [insert your own name] would do. I have applied this rule many times. And I have lamented its violations. But I have never whined. If whining means complaining in a high-pitched helpless tone about something completely changeable. If whining is the verbal equivalent of throwing your arms up in the air. No, I don’t get exasperated easily. Many people do. Not me. I don’t throw my arms up, I cross them. Instead of whining, I count positives. When I’m down in the dumps, I count my way out, one positive at a time. I take the raw material of those positives and fashion my own stepping-stairs. And I count them. I count the stepping-stairs as I climb. And this is not just some touchy-feely abstraction, not for me. I actually sit down, at my desk, with a pad of graph paper, and I trace. Up &#8230; right &#8230; up &#8230; right &#8230;. along the lines, ascending from the lower left of the grid to the upper-right-most box. My stepping-stairs. Underneath each step, to the right of it, and starting at the bottom, I write down one positive. I am always careful to keep each letter in its own square of the grid. As the positives stack up, I might need to abbreviate words, and on the loftiest steps, I use only the most telling acronyms. At the very top step, on a single box of the grid, always one letter: I. That letter always has to have the top crossed and bottom crossed too, to distinguish it from a nail or spike, and sometimes I fill that part of the stairs in first, since it’s often the only one I know right away. It doesn’t matter what order I fill in the other steps. What matters is simply that n they each contain another positive.</p>

<p>The graph paper I use smells like new carpet. It’s fifty-six units tall. That’s fifty-six plush positives. I usually don’t have a problem getting thirty right away. The others take time, and sometimes I cheat a little, but it’s for my own good. The important thing is to fill all of them out, and know what they represent: fifty-six positives. Holy cow, I always say, Wow, that is more than I thought I had.</p>

<p>The unstated converse of the NBP dictum, of course, was: “Don’t count your releases before they roll.”</p>

<p>Perhaps I needed to be more of a squeaky spindle, not less. Despite all my guidance, somehow Renaldo convinced Tony to use that wacky new build system. I should have stepped in and made an executive veto. Renaldo’s build system: a legacy, a real dinosaur skeleton from an open-source silicon-valley brainfart called Tarpit that owed its organizing principles to the behemoth tape-driven mainframes of the industry’s earliest failures. Oh but Renaldo has forged a special influence with Tony. Maybe Tony is a gay-gay with a crush on the surfer guy. Maybe Tony has just been going out of his mind. Whatever the case, Renaldo has always had Tony eating out of his hand. All he has to do is say, “Check this out, Tony, this is what we used at SolaX,” and Tony will pant and drool to learn whatever it is. I should have demanded that Tony keep me in that loop. Then I would have never let him Renaldo-up our systems. Had I not had to wrestle with that Tarpit trestle these last two weeks, I could have closed all the bugs myself, and we would have launched in time for Mallsoft Systems Labs to reconsider their dream-making/breaking investment. We would have at least given them a choice. Instead, they must have looked at us and thought: not a chance.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>The two heroes—fair to call them that whether they’ve done heroic deeds or not—have settled into a table in the corner under the television, near the hallway that leads to the bathrooms. The television keeps blipping between the World Wars channel and MSNN. The sound is off, captions on, and the cops don’t need it. They don’t need the sound or the screen. They already know what the world is up to. They undoubtedly know what history has shown us. You can almost see it in the dull shine of their pupils, the florid excitement on their cheeks. The shine of condensation on their bushy mustaches. The way their agile fingers rest on the table tops, at the ready. The way their CPD jackets stay zipped up tight. And their expressions: placid, stern, just barely masking their compassion for the public. Some people think it’s a joke, all these real details, all the typical things like the mustaches, the jowls, the stern looks, but none of it is a joke. There are good reasons for these things. Historical reasons, institutional reasons. Life lessons. Get with the program, Renaldo. Maybe take a look and get a clue and take a cue. You can talk all you want about fighting the system, but you are part of it, pal. You’re sitting here, and they’re sitting here. We’re sitting here. And right now, they serve a more important purpose than either of us.</p>

<p>And some people think they’re a joke. It doesn’t help that one of them is pouring something from a flask into his iced tea. Or that the other is eating the rind off a slice of lemon, spitting a lemon seed into his cradling palm and looking at it with an expression of horror. That the other is looking at it now too, and asking what it is. I salute them both, because when the jokes start flying around, someone has to stand up and respect things. Sometimes the things people find funny are not funny at all. And that in itself is amusing to me.</p>

<p>The whole scene just keeps me smiling. I smile at them, waiting for a bit of a nod, something. Let’s get some solidarity here guys. But they don’t seem to notice. And they don’t notice the salute I reserve for uniformed public servants either, a hand of benediction, two fingers of pope blessing tapped on the old noggin, then aimed at them with a wink. Stay vigilant, fellas.</p>

<p>“So much for your superstition,” I say to Renaldo.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. Maybe just that—”</p>

<p>But hold the Phonia. A very suspicious-looking entourage has just entered the bar area. Three dark-skinned men with close-set, glittering eyes—all wearing identical black suits and black ties. Severe noses, goatees.</p>

<p>Oh, I wish Renaldo would notice this. I nudge him, to no avail. I would love to hear what he thinks these bozos are up to. Here’s a clue: they’re not Middle <em>Western</em>.</p>

<p>They’re shown to a round table by a squinty-eyed girl who sticks her face out too far in front of her body. She purses her lips tightly and passes out menus. These guys seem furtive, and, in fact, they <em>are</em> furtive. And what’s worse: they’re all wearing sport sandals. All three of them. One of them even wiggles his toes as the menus are distributed. Fortunately the two officers are keeping watchful eyes trained on the scene while they gnaw on giant Bavarian pretzels. Under my breath, I thank the Patriot Act and swivel back to the bar.</p>

<h3>THE NATURAL VIRGIN</h3>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<p>There is no reason for a life partner to dislike me. I’m attractive, have earning potential, provide comfort and safety for my family; I make sensible decisions. I’m a fun guy to be around, all the time. I’ve never had anyone give me a good reason, to my face, why they might not prefer my company. Especially my wife. Through all of the difficulties life has presented, Jenna has been the one vehicle to carry us through the bad traffic, with a remarkable pair of headlights to guide the way. I have to admit, it’s spectacular. I don’t know how she does it. She’s a remarkable woman. </p>

<p>I’ve tried to know the Jenna that existed before me. It’s a feat of imagination in most cases. Except for that one moment when she walked up to the beer trough without a beer ticket. That was pretty close. That was electrical. It was the charge that made me do everything. And it was only about potential. It wasn’t about anything I knew about her; it was what I didn’t know. She was the Jenna before me, and in twenty-four hours, she became something different: the Jenna, before me.</p>

<p>Jenna once told me that she spent a lot of her high school years priding herself on her virginity. She said she believed some people were natural virgins, meaning they were always virginal, and she thought she was one of those people. If you had sex and you married the person who had sex with you, you were still a virgin as long as you hadn’t had sex with anyone else. She told me she’d never had sex with anyone else. I was the first. And the only one.</p>

<p>I’ve asked her about her childhood, her high school days, plenty of times. She said in high school she reinvented herself, and in college, she reinvented herself again. But she didn’t call it reinvention. She called it shedding, and said that the word shedding still wasn’t even close to being a good description. Switching was a better term, but switching a lot of things at once, in a different pattern. And that was maybe the easiest way for me to understand it. But I don’t really understand it.</p>

<p>After we were married, she told me a lot more things than I ever knew. She said when she got to high school, she switched a lot of things. I didn’t know what that meant. She said for example, in high school she switched from flute to cello. I said that didn’t seem like such a big deal. She gave other examples: not switches but choices, which were kind of like switches because they took things one way or another. She didn’t try out for the cheerleading squad because cheerleaders were sluts. She ran cross country. She enjoyed listening to classical music during her warmups. Warmups, cool downs, and stretching were her favorite aspects of the sport. But only stretching if she could do it alone. During these activities she would get lost between her headphones. She chose different music from her peers. She listened to Liszt, Wagner, Dobrzinski, Vivaldi, Mozart, Bartok, Handel, Smetana. In her journal she referred to herself as the BAV. I asked what that meant and she said Big Ass Victory, but then on another occasion, she said Born Again Virgin. I asked her to clarify the difference between that and the Natural Virgin once. She shrugged and said she guessed they were kind of the same. It was stupid, sure, high school girl stuff. It was just a way she could refer to herself in her journal, sometimes, when she didn’t want anyone who snooped to know she was talking about herself. The BAV, she said, did a lot of things that would have made her parents feel sad for the BAV. The BAV was her but it was also not her. When she went to college, she switched everything again. She stopped playing cello, stopped keeping the journal, joined a sorority, started drinking, met me, started doing it. Actually, the way she put it was: she did it with me once, and then did it again, and again, in the same night, and then, only then, she started having sex with me for real. I’ve asked a dozen or more times: what does that mean, for real? She doesn’t know. She dropped Vivaldi, sought out more operas. To understand this, she told me, that first evening she met me, imagine this: you’ve left your real self at home. It’s a feeling like dreams give you, where things don’t matter, because the real you is somewhere else. She let me give her drinks, she went upstairs with me, let me take off her clothes. In high school, she’d been good, better than any of her friends, for sure, at putting the brake on things when necessary. She was only going to let it go so far. But because she let it go farther than she’d allowed in high school, she didn’t know anymore how to stop it. In junior high, she said, she had no brakes at all. And suddenly, in college, it felt like that again.</p>

<p>This was where she lost me. And we’ve talked about that evening many times. Most memorably the day after, when our very first Thoughts-and-Feelings Dialog occurred. And I’ve never understood it. It’s as if she’s leaving something out. The way she puts it: it didn’t matter; then it happened, once; and then it doubly didn’t matter. And this voice she said she always had, all the way through grade school and high school, said now it mattered half as much, right? So it happened again. She wasn’t worried about the usual things—would I call her in the morning, would I lose respect for her, etc—she didn’t care anymore, after the second time, about any of that usual stuff. And after the third time, she worried that she was no better than the person she’d tried to escape. Whatever that meant. She was just that person now, and she hadn’t left her real self at home, all of her was here. She wasn’t just acting like a whore, she was a whore.</p>

<p>“You’re not a whore,” I said. “You were not a whore.” I was careful not to present it as a ridiculous statement. I’ve said it many times, and always at least once when we have a conversation about that evening.</p>

<p>She’d left that journal sitting in her old bedroom, and, worried her parents would find it while she was away from school, she went home one weekend, got it, drove out to Lambert Lake, stood on the leaf-spotted bank, and threw it as far as she could over the water.</p>

<p>The pages seemed to fly open on their own. They beat like wings, she said. I could picture the moment vividly. The breeze caught it and suspended it for a moment, and then it dropped softly, making a noise like a slap. The way she describes this event is carefully. More carefully than any other event in her life that she has described to me. And I can’t make anything of it. I can see it though. The journal floated there on its spine, with the pages fanned, as concentric ripples grew from it. It seemed to take a long time to sink, and when it did, she thought she could see it waving at her just beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Julia is talking about drugs now. Renaldo brought up the topic. Fortunately, there are no kids nearby. Not very many at least. The ones here are at a far table, near the stairway to the second level, and they’re climbing on their chairs. The parents are pretending not to notice. Julia says, “So when the larney got back to the guy’s place, the monkey was on the ceiling fan and the chicks were long gone!”</p>

<p>Renaldo rocks with laughter.</p>

<p>“Renaldo,” I say, but he’s too busy laughing.</p>

<p>A guy in a suit approaches the end of the bar and Julia straightens her face as if her whole mood was a masquerade, goes to him with a down-to-business look and a napkin.</p>

<p>“Renaldo!”</p>

<p>He’s been laughing so hard he’s crying, or maybe he’s really been crying, but now he’s laughing because he has a smile on his face. But his face is red and his squinting eyes glisten with—yes, tears! Oh, it’s just so funny. This Julia really tells a good one, doesn’t she?</p>

<p>“Hey, Renaldo!”</p>

<p>His head hangs, the laughter ebbs. He brushes at the corner of one eye, squeezes a single tear out. “Hey,” he says, finally.</p>

<p>I say: “You went to Stanford, right?”</p>

<p>He says yeah.</p>

<p>I say: “But you’re from Naperville.”</p>

<p>He says yeah, so what?</p>

<p>I say: “You could have gone to the University of Illinois, just as good a school and a heckuva better deal.”</p>

<p>He looks irritated, and goes into an explanation.</p>

<p>It boils down to something like this:</p>

<p>He wanted to study Asians—Asian studies he calls it—and really, Stanford looked better across the board for minoring in that and majoring in CS, except no more snow, except to snowboard on, but also surfing whenever, which was nice—you know, Cali.</p>

<p>“But when it came down to it, I think I just had to get out of Naperville, man.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just, it was just so bad.”</p>

<p>I laugh. “But why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, man. It just seemed bad for me, okay?”</p>

<p>Of course he doesn’t understand the great things about living in the greatest metro area in the country. Diversity. Opportunity. Choices. Wealth. Safety. Community. We need to protect all this. Not run away. Especially not to a place like California. What a fantasy world.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what’s so great about California,” I tell him.</p>

<p>He shakes his head, too long, letting it droop down as he does, as if my comment just makes him &#8230; so &#8230; incredibly tired.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he says, a sardonic grin creeping wider to spread his goatee outward. “Let me see, um, beaches? Sunshine, avocados, prehistoric trees.” And now Julia is nodding, apparently listening to this while she taps beer for someone. Renaldo chuckles. “How about fun fresh salads and passionfruit iced tea!”</p>

<p>And he whoops it up, like this is the funniest thing anyone’s ever said. Julia shakes her head sadly, while smiling.</p>

<p>“Woo hoo!” I shout. “And how about strident whores, wayward teens, cross-dressing baseball fans, vegetarian gangbangers, bleeding-heart entrepreneurs, serial-killer handymen, and rampant Mexicans? How about all that stuff too? You gonna defend any of that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, man,” Renaldo says. Again with the sardonic sadness. “You are such a racist.”</p>

<p>I correct him on that one. “I said rampant Mexicans, not <em>all</em> Mexicans.”</p>

<p>It could also be known as the land of soggy pizza. Or the home of disgusting lifestyles: leathery musclebound geriatrics benching on the beach and flip-flopped ladymen baring their hairy thighs as they kick back with a latté in a fingermug. And deranged homeless professors who drop their pants at the bus stop and deposit a California pizza on the sidewalk in front of indifferent, designer-sunglassy lovers of public transportation and milky drinks. And wife-killing moviestars, neighbor-killing pit bulls, Cambodian rip-off artists, pedophiliac surfers, pothead policemen, legally protected squatters, hippies shambling across college campuses in drug-induced fugues; soft-spoken UFO worshippers taking cyanide; casserole-making, SupperCare-toting sex-clubbers; aggressively misanthropic tent citizens; peyote-murder cultists—and e coli spreaders. A utopia of pipe dreams, false hopes, deviant desires, drug overdoses, murder-suicides, forest fires, and earthquakes.</p>

<p>Great place to go to school, Renaldo. Great place to be named Renaldo. Just perfect for you.</p>

<p>For the record, I would love to live in Naperville. It’s one of the fastest expanding suburban communities in the country. The village of Schaumburg, sad to say, has almost hit the limits of its tax base. In other words, taxes are going to start skyrocketing. And while Schaumburg is one of the only towns in America to have no municipal property tax, the day that changes, Jenna and I might consider moving to Naperville. Because a town like Naperville has such a phenomenal tax base—growing so quick, every year!—that they can actually afford to keep lowering taxes. The new high school there, the third one, would be an excellent place to send Ethan to school one day. Maybe for a character like Renaldo, a true misfit, it was best to leave Naperville, and for that matter the whole state, but still, I have to wonder: if the left coast is so frickin great, why would he ever move back here?</p>

<p>I not only wonder this, I ask him.</p>

<p>“You know,” he says. “I’ve always thought you were a dick. I guess I can say that now, huh?”</p>

<p>Renaldo calling me a dick! Just because I have some sense in my head about how to live my life and how to make good decisions and raise a family. He’s the dick, the goatfaced hippy! He wasted his money on a snobby school, drifted from relationship to relationship, lost his job, and almost didn’t get that job (if only I’d been at work that Monday!), and he slouches, smells bad, and follows some delusional romantic ideal about being bohemian. And he’s a pirate, a music-pirating, copyright violating thief! So, who’s the dick? I ask him: “Just who’s being a dick right now? You or me?”</p>

<p>“You are!”</p>

<p>“You’re the dick who’s calling me a dick!”</p>

<p>“You’re asking inflammatory questions, trying to piss me off. You’re also asking about personal stuff I don’t want to talk about.”</p>

<p>“Well, then admit you wasted your frickin money!”</p>

<p>“I did not waste my money.”</p>

<p>“Well, if California’s so great, why did you come running back here so soon? Why did you leave the dream job you had at SolaX? Why leave behind all the surfing and snowboarding and drug abuse and loose foreign women and tofu to come back here, if you think here is such a bad place?”</p>

<p>“Cause my ma got really sick.”</p>

<p>He doesn’t look at me. He looks over at Julia, who is releasing an avalanche of ice from a plastic bucket. It makes a sound like a death rattle. Still without looking at me, he kills the beer.</p>

<p>I say: Oh.</p>

<p>The University of Illinois is a fine school. It might be the best school for engineering outside of MIT. It is the top accounting school in the nation. Some people like to slight it. It’s downstate, what a crime. Granted, it’s not in an area where most towns are given comfortable names as they are in the Greater Chicago Metro Area. In the boonies, there are no comfortable couplings of the words wood, grove, elm, stream, deer, forest, elk, heights, estates, meadows, park, glen, hills, or river. But still: the downstate campus is far superior, academically, to the one here in Chicago. Like the body’s most important circulator, it constantly pumps enriched cells back up to the brain of the state. At homecoming, from my seat among the donors, I use binoculars to look across the stadium at the orangeish lifeblood of the University: the orange rippling square of the spirit block with its droves of teenage students holding coordinated signboards. Spirited, energetic, some of them with their bare thoraxes painted, all of them with respectable hairstyles, well-proportioned faces and bodies, healthy skin. The marching band holding brass behind the end zone, the cheerleaders with pumping fists and pop-eyed head nods, and the dance team in their short skirts and flesh tights. My binos spend some time trained on them. After a homecoming game, I always cherish taking a stroll down the strip on a Saturday night to see further multitudes. They travel in same-sex packs from bar to bar, all the time vigilant, the men flexing biceps as they talk on cell phones, shouting unprovoked shouts at non-shouters, shouting provoked back at unprovoked shouts, swaggering, putting each other in check (easy, hardon!) And the women, still girls really, teetering on heels, locking arms, pretending not to notice the shouting. Nine thousand freshmen every fall. A year or two of sex with random strangers, maybe just a single faster-than-the-speed-limit encounter or two. Then, through the magic of the Greek subsystem, they pair off.</p>

<p>The beauty of that system—and my pledge dad Ray agrees—is its perpetuation of domestic pedigree. It’s wondrous. And yet there are inevitably some who don’t accept it as what it is. Rejecting Renaldos, whiny eurofags, cynical hipsters, and other droopy desperadoes. The confused ones who decide to attend the largest Greek system in the nation but don’t want to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>And why not? Even the most burrowing bookworms, if they have any trace of interest in the opposite sex, can and do partake. EngiNerds and Ag-heads have their own fraternities. There’s a place for anyone (except gays). There was even one house known for its collection of exquisite dorks, a gaggle of eccentric and self-absorbed weirdos: a Renaldo house if there ever was one.</p>

<p>As my pledge dad Ray says, you have to partner up to get through this world. One way or another. Those who don’t are at a serious disadvantage.</p>

<p>And why would anyone want that? Short answer: they wouldn’t. Life is a game of navigation. It does require someone in the passenger seat. It does require a co-pilot to read the Tellmepower-dot-com map printout. Life only goes in one direction, to one location, and it’s how you get there that matters.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>During the final phases of getting the new house done, about seven months into Jenna’s pregnancy with Ethan, we heard on the news that a baby was crushed in its carrier by a garage door. It happened right in our old neighborhood of Thornberry Hills. The mother, in tears, said: “It were a lack of adequate safety features. It weren’t no defect. IT WERE A LACK OF ADEQUATE SAFETY FEATURES.” I pointed out that the real defect was in the brain of this woman who set her child under the door, but the comedic touch was lost on Jenna. I was only making a joke—the woman was probably right. I agreed with Jenna, and the woman. Too many things do not have adequate safety features, that is the truth, however incorrect the grammar.</p>

<p>That night Jenna had a vivid dream. From time to time she had these dreams. Sometimes she calls out, and sometimes she sits bolt upright. She woke from this one kicking me in the back. She was kicking fairly hard, actually, until she was aware of what was happening. When she recovered, she said, “I was being crushed.”</p>

<p>I had only fallen halfway out of bed, and I quickly slid back under the covers. I sidled next to her. Her voice in the darkness: “Please don’t touch me.”</p>

<p>I removed my hand from her shoulder, whispered, “It was only a dream.”</p>

<p>“There was this huge crushing feeling,” she said.</p>

<p>I whispered: “I told you these feather ones were too hot.” I said it in the most soothing tone. Her response was: “From inside and out.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I soothed, not knowing if she was referring to the comforters or not. “Okay.”</p>

<p>She refused to discuss the dream any more. By dinner the next day, she announced the decision was made. I asked what decision. She said, “How much money to spend on the garage doors.”</p>

<p>I asked, “So how much do we spend?”</p>

<p>“As much as we can. I can’t put a cap on Ethan’s life.”</p>

<p>I was all for being frugal, but you can’t argue with dreams. I couldn’t rationally contend with this mysterious experience she had, of being crushed from both sides. Or top and bottom. Whatever it was. We bought three of the most sensitive door openers on the market. They were so sensitive that when I tested one with a cantaloupe (dusted with flour as suggested on Tellmepower-dot-com), the door reversed perfectly, leaving the cantaloupe unmolested, the flour undisturbed, and myself deeply impressed. Of course, I thought: you can pay for that kind of safety, and it’s worth it. It is a sensitivity-based safety. It is the kind of sensitivity that allows Jenna to sleep soundly; of course it’s worth it. Even if it’s a hair-trigger sensitivity that keeps the farthest door from opening at all, sometimes, it’s worth it. And so what if one of the rollers has some imperfection in its casting and it’s just big enough to trigger the safety reversal. So what if I haven’t yet gotten around to disassembling the thing to exchange it for a working assembly? It’s worth it.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>The vocation of parenting is chock full of moments of marvel. Our Ethan has given us some wondrous moments. He gets us on the balls of our feet tiptoeing to the mini-crib, where he’ll be sitting baby-style, like a little fat man pleasantly chewing on the fingers of one hand while the other hand plucks at the fuzz of his aqua jumper. There he sits, content, looking up at us with a slobbering mouth. Jenna has to fend off his tiny hands as they go for her breasts. He can also sing, playact, do sit-down dances, play musical instruments made of safe plastic, crawl commando-style and make firm demands like a little generalissimo. And he has seemingly understood spoken language from the day he could recognize us.</p>

<p>When Ethan was born, he weighed ten pounds and seven ounces. He was the color of cinnamon applesauce and had a lopsided blob of a head and a squinty little Eskimo face. It was quite a surprise to think that a face like that came from my wife’s body. It was like a bran flake that stares up from your cereal bowl. But still, we could see the resemblance, immediately. Every time he grimaced with the coursing fluids and burgeoning gas of his fledgling digestive tract, Jenna saw—she insisted—a prototype of my face, or at least my mouth with very frothy corners.</p>

<p>On his first day in our home, his eyes were closed as he looked up at us. Completely sealed shut, with force, it seemed. Occasionally he would open them, wide, look at us with them fully fixed on our faces. We exchanged speculation about whose eyes he had. “Mine,” Jenna would say. “No, mine,” I’d say. And then Ethan would close them tight again and begin to scream. He would scream so loud he almost choked on his own screams. When he screamed like that, his whole body trembled in our arms. It was magnificent. The first time we witnessed it, we smiled at each other. It was a real moment. I told Jenna that. I told her that a moment like that one, that kind of moment, was what it was all about.</p>

<p>When he was only weeks old, we wanted him to experience his first family portrait session. This was before I took the job at NDC. Before Renaldo, before Jenna left Arlensin, before I had the Beamer. We were both mostly sleepless and overworked then, but always elated, and surprised every day by our new bundle. It seems decades away now, that Saturday morning. I remember we woke up and had waffles, the three of us. Then we spent a good hour together in the master bathroom, grooming. We struck various poses in the mirror, rehearsing for the shot. We passed Ethan back and forth and tweaked his pink cheeks. I held him, just under my chest, while looking piercingly across my shoulder. Jenna held his back against her breasts and showed him the mirror. I held him again, smiling across his fragrant fontanel. Jenna pressed against my side, put a hand on my back and another on her cocked hip. We all smiled at ourselves. It was a good morning. Ethan was looking rosy and unusually wide-eyed. His poo at dawn had been a dark brown pudding, with a healthy nutty odor. His appetite had come back. At breakfast, while we munched on pancakes, he gorged himself on Jenna’s breasts. We were on top of the world. “Look out, mall,” I said to our reflections. “Here come the Tidwells. All three of us. And Ethan, you’re the new voice here. You’re going to help with this decision. It’s the very first decision you’ll help us make!”</p>

<p>There had been a scare with the breast milk, there. It was only the second day Jenna had breastfed him. She hadn’t wanted to, not at first. For one, she didn’t think her breasts were large enough. Actually, they’re just the perfect size, with nipples as erect as pencil erasers. She didn’t see how they could hold enough milk for a child. Plus, one never knew what a mother’s body could pass along to a child. Teratogens, to be sure. Also allergens. Carcinogens. Peanut oil is always a concern. And listeria. Soft cheeses contain listeria. Any milk, even mother’s milk, could contain listeria. Listeria thrives in milk products. If a mother consumed any milk product with listeria in it, the listeria could, technically, be present in the breast milk. And this was the clincher. Jenna read this somewhere and it clinched it. She decided immediately that breastfeeding would be too much of a risk. A formula would be the better option.</p>

<p>I was prepared to accept whatever decision she made, but I did some research on it. It sounded like urban legend, at first. But it checked out on TellMePower-dot-com. The same details. It was important to pay attention to new scientific knowledge. In the end, I agreed with Jenna that we were better safe than sorry. There was no room for risks. Not in raising a child. We decided to find a compromise. In those first two crucial weeks we would heat her own breast milk gently to 140 degrees—proper pasteurization temperature if maintained for at least ten minutes—and store it refrigerated in Kylie Jensen Flexi-glass bottles. These are high-end sports bottles with phthalate-and-xenoestrogen-free silicone nipples, guaranteed by the Kylie Jensen company to be sterile once sealed. This would allow Ethan the joy of drinking mother’s milk, without the dangers of listeria. This seemed like the perfect solution, so to speak. Every day, Jenna pumped her milk out, gently warmed it on the stove, and sealed it in the bottles. The first few days Ethan devoured it. But then he drank less of it, and then he started to spit it out. Finally he refused to swallow it at all. In distress, Jenna called Dr. Mashay on the land line and put him on speaker. He reiterated that he thought we should have never been treating the milk that way. As usual with doctors, when asked a direct question, he ducked behind textbook generalities and finally came out to say that no conclusive studies have recommended for or against the pasteurization of breast milk. He recommended direct feeding, and if that failed, a formula. Jenna took his advice, same day. She sat down on the couch and pulled her blouse open, freed her breasts, and for the first time, put one in front of Ethan’s face. I found myself looking at them as eagerly as Ethan should have been. They were as swollen as they’d ever been, the nipples protruberant and almost livid.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to massage the areolas?” I offered. “It might help him to get a drop first.”</p>

<p>“No, I think he’ll figure it out.”</p>

<p>“Right. Okay.”</p>

<p>It was a shocking situation to suddenly put him in, to be sure. He must have felt the pressure. We couldn’t blame the guy for just lying there squinting and dribbling on himself. At some point instinct had to kick in.</p>

<p>“Put his face on it,” I suggested. “On it, like directly against it.”</p>

<p>“I think he’ll get it.”</p>

<p>“Or maybe if you rub his face with your nipple.”</p>

<p>“I think he’ll figure it out,” she reiterated.</p>

<p>“Okay, sure.” I stared at her nipples, at his pink face, the same pink color as the nipples. He would figure it out. He was a smart kid.</p>

<p>He did figure it out. And when he did, he really did. He finished the first one off in what from my vantage appeared to be one extended suck. Then he dispatched the other with equal gusto. I applauded so loudly my palms stung. I leapt around the room and made the sound of a straw slurping the bottom of a cup. It made me proud, that kind of appetite. It made us both proud. We decided something that good could not possibly be risky. We dismissed the transferrable-listeria as hearsay and agreed we should continue with this. Jenna, smiling as she unlatched Ethan, started to cry. Ethan’s eyes rolled drunkenly. My own burned, and I wiped a single tear from one, looked at it drying on the whorls of my thumb, and had to laugh. That night was the first vaginal sex we had since before we confirmed the pregnancy. In bed, in the dark, as I pulled her nightgown up to her neck, I asked to suckle one of her breasts. I said I would be very gentle. I promised I wouldn’t be as rough as our strapping boy. She laughed. And denied me. I begged her, in a whisper. Then I demanded, in a scary, Transylvanian Vampire voice, to suck her boob. Get away, she said. I asked one more time, in a normal tone, just me, Chad, asking nicely if I could. I told her it was too wonderful to pass up. No, she told me, smiling. No, Chad. I put my hands on her rib cage and nodded solemnly. That was fine. I said it was just fine. I was only half-joking, but it was fine.</p>

<p>The Precious Times studio had never seen such a trio. We sure were a happy unit, as we perused the floor-to-ceiling samples, the other happy (but fakely so) units smiling back at us from their frames. We held Ethan out so he could see each one. A clerk named Bertie with long hair and a horsey face and goatee (a shade Renaldo) tried hopelessly to help us. Surely, I observed to myself, the only real outsider here, was the inside man, Bertie, because he had no idea. No idea what joy we had. And he looked as if he didn’t even know that he had no idea.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Ethan was first to suggest a style. Jenna called across the display floor. She was very excited. I strolled over, my hands in my pockets, as caj as casual could be. Bertie stood by her, his arms crossed, smiling, nodding and glancing once when he thought I wasn’t looking, at her breasts. Ethan was excited too, reaching his little hand as far as he could. He was really nothing more than a wriggling newt, at that age, but he had chosen something, and the excitement of making a decision was making him torque himself around by kicking his legs back against Jenna. “He picked something,” I crowed. “That’s great. Just wonderful. Has he been excited about any of the others?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “I almost walked right by this one, until he started to squirm.”</p>

<p>“He’s got good taste,” Bertie said.</p>

<p>“Are you sure he’s not ready for a diaper change?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The kid’s got some soul,” Bertie said. “The cool thing about this one is the background—that tortoiseshell in black-and-orange fading to black. It has that clean, Motown feel. Like a high-top fade. And the olive velvet cushion with the tassels really complements it. Plus it’s shot through a soft white-light filter, gives it that gauzy feel and cuts down on the shine.”</p>

<p>Ethan wriggled toward it, his eyes coming to rest on it briefly between headrolls. He clearly couldn’t see anything but gaudy blurs of color. His sense of beauty was probably as underdeveloped as his vision. Nevertheless, he seemed to have chosen it. Choices are the first thing a child truly owns. This was our first parenting dilemma—the need for our own choice, our choice to confirm or veto his choice, to make the right choice, even if meant denying our only son, denying his wish because we can see it, and see it in a way he’s not yet capable, which is to say, crisply and perspicaciously.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t really a dilemma, because we both knew we didn’t want that look. I said to Bertie, “Do you have anything more &#8230; or less &#8230; something?”</p>

<p>“Uh,” Bertie said. “Do you mean &#8230;” </p>

<p>“I mean, something a little more neutral. In tone.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Yeah, well, like the most popular is like pretty conservative, you know, plain-vanilla.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that sounds very appealing.”</p>

<p>I wandered away, browsed the other side again. I found something buried in a stack of portraits leaning against the front counter, something perfect. Jenna and Ethan were at my side. Her joy was gone now, and I could feel impatience emanating from her like the rich odor that had begun to waft from my squirming son. But this new urgency was to my advantage. “It’s different,” I told her. “Not many people have this sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Bertie said, sidling with a vengeance. “Some people like that sort of thing too. Or not. It’s more of a painting kind of effect. We call that the Great Impasto. It’s created after the photo is taken, with the computer and stuff.”</p>

<p>I asked Bertie if we could have our portrait treated like that. The Great Impasto. I liked the sound of it. “Let’s do it,” I said to Jenna. It would be classical, artsy. Like the royal courts of yore, a commished masterpiece in oleo. “Settled,” I told Bertie.</p>

<p>It’s hanging over the couch in the living room now, and we’ve had many a guest remark upon it. By all appearances, they agree, it does resemble a professionally consigned impasto oil-portrait. A classic style.</p>

<p>When we first hung it, that evening, we gazed in awe, the three of us. It was a good moment, and one that we both especially cherish. A precious time, if you will.</p>

<p>As things turned out, the milk and its buoyancy did not last long. In the following weeks, Jenna’s reserves mysteriously diminished. Finally, they dried up completely.</p>

<p>These things happen. We didn’t let it faze us. We switched to formula. And guess what? Ethan still loved us back.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Jenna will appreciate my candor. I just need to tell her how it is, and reassure her how it will be. After this last beer is gone, I will call. I will tell her everything. Just one small sip now, toward breaking the news later.</p>

<p>The poster behind the bar depicts seven of the Xtra Light Bubble Girls gathered around a beer trough that’s brimming over with bubble bath, each holding their own translucent bubble ball aloft as if holding the whole world up to see. I gaze at the most Jenna-like of them: a waify vixen with the smallest and perkiest chassis. Another one of them, the tall svelte one able to hold her Bubble ball up much higher than the others, reminds me of Myrianna. At least, the legs, hips, breasts and stomach do. Not the face. Definitely not the face. Myrianna’s face normally has a dour look. It’s capable of a lot of expressions, but not many of them are pleasant. At least not to me. Not one of them is as pleasant as this Bubble Girl’s look of gleeful abandon, of bubbly willingness, of fervent assuredness.</p>

<p>Myrianna likes to think of herself as a real fashionista, a diva, but the reality is that much of the time she wears baggy collared sweatshirts, nylon track pants and little wireframe glasses, and when her hair’s not gelled she could be someone’s seventeen-year old son. Not exactly a babe. And she still lives in the same house in Thornberry Hills, our old neighborhood, but minus her husband, Donald. She considers herself chic for being single. But as a neighborhood, it’s hardly what you’d call chic. Not even in a retro way. I’m certain she considers herself retro. She’d call it midcentury or something. As if small garages, inefficient cars, and no cable news were good things. As if martini-sourced cirrhosis and kidney failure were the new black. Yeah right, Myrianna. With your little haircut and tiny waist and slightly parted lips. You have no idea how lucky Jenna is to have me.</p>

<p>When we dined at their place, her husband Donald would come back from the kitchen with cocktails for himself and me (they were very strong) and the two of us would sit there pretending not to examine each other in the glass of the patio door. Every now and then he would start going on and on about photons. He asked once if I was aware of what happens when photons hit glass. He said that when photons hit glass, some pass through and some bounce back. “Imagine a dotted line,” he said, “Heading right for that pane of glass. And some of the dots pass through, and some bounce back.”</p>

<p>What a mismatch that was. Nevertheless, we found ourselves over at their house, or felt obligated to have them in ours, and the four of us would have dinner, wine and pound cake with lemon sauce, and Jenna and Myrianna would do mind-melds while Donald and I silently stared each other down.</p>

<p>He was a birdwatcher—thankfully the only one I’ve ever known. He would drone for hours about birds, especially their mating rituals. Whenever I steered the conversation toward business or technology his eyes would glaze over and he’d get an irritated thrust to his jaw, cross his legs the other way, stick his ass out toward me, and begin to watch Jenna. The avid way he looked at her never failed to razz me, as did the way neither of them seemed to care about it. Just to get him to stop it, and to avoid more discussion of birds, I would ask him about his other favorite hobby—making his own paper. And he would stop undressing Jenna, turn toward me again, and launch into his pulping process or his pressing materials. If the women were out of earshot, he’d go into vivid descriptions about the various ways he’d like to mount such-and-such woman from the park district classes he taught.</p>

<p>I was positive he was joking the first time he told me he was into this paper making hobby. I said, “Get out! Why would you want to do that?” And I was even vaguely interested, at first. But after many micro-lectures about materials and drying methods, I began to despise the topic nearly as much as birds. He must have thought I was still interested, because one time he brought over a sample from his class. It looked like fake vomit, except it was paper.</p>

<p>One thing I enjoyed about the visits to their house was that Myrianna subscribed to a fashion magazine called Le Chatte Exposé which was chock full of semi-nude business women. Mostly open blouses and slit skirts. Only a few gowns, of the funereal variety, black with lots of dotted lace and long gloves. Gowns for lady diplomats. And no dresses at all. Nothing girly or too devil-may-care casual. A lot of heels and hose, purses and umbrellas, tasteful jewelry, and smooth leather executive cases. I admit I’ve appropriated a few copies of it now and then, stashing them here and there, shrugging and looking befuddled when Jenna wants to return it to Myrianna and can’t find it. “Isn’t it just paper?” I ask. “It probably got thrown away.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t mine,” Jenna says, and at that point I shrug with an unconcerned stare fixed on her. “Sorry,” I say.</p>

<p>This is how Myrianna hugs Jenna:</p>

<p>Close, arms wrapped completely around, cheek to cheek, eyes closed. Sometimes her hands hold the back of Jenna’s head. In any case, their bosoms are pressed together. They never hugged this way when Donald was around. It’s as if they’ve been through some kind of trauma together. Jenna hugs back with equal pressure. Then Myrianna stands back from Jenna, holding her by the shoulders, regarding and inspecting her like a little girl adoring her dolly. Sometimes I want to turn away, but I can’t.</p>

<p>Myrianna: “I love those jeans. They’re very slimming.” Jenna: “You think so?” Myrianna: “Fa shizzle, beeyatch!” Jenna: “Well, you look divine. I could eat you, girlcookie!” Both giggling with reckless abandon. This is a fairly new habit, calling each other “girrul frands,” like they’re black ladies on daytime TV. And then there’s Myrianna’s boyishly cropped hair, and her one short nail. Her taut neck, a small tattoo of either a sun or flower on her left shoulder (espied partly hidden by a strap several summers ago as Jenna and I followed her and Donald through the park and I conducted my usual surreptitious examination of Myrianna’s backside). And now, the <em>girrul frand</em> business. It didn’t take long for me to hit my limit with the constant citations of Daddy Ray’s Crib dialog. Not that it’s a bad show. Not that I haven’t laughed at Daddy Ray’s personal take on the Honey-I’m-home line, as he flings open the front door, his big fat body filling the door frame, his construction hat still on, shouting so his jowls shake: “Daddy Ray Need Lovin!” It happens at least once every episode, and never fails to make us snicker. Because we know Mama, his equal in obesity and antagonism, is going to say something mean to him, but we don’t know what. “You at the wrong address for lovin, Mongo.” And when he says “You large and in charge, Mama!” we anticipate the roll of her eyes, and still it’s never too predictable. Oh, the put-downs on that show! The banter between Ray and Mama, always revolving around girth or lighting on the shade of their skin. “You blacker than a hoecake in a lightnin fire.” &#8230; ”Oh, no. No, you didn’t just say that. You blacker than coal on a scarecrow!”</p>

<p>If only Myrianna and Jenna wouldn’t imitate Daddy Ray’s smartass daughters. Of all the characters, those skinny little teenagers are the most smart-alecky ones on the show to persistently mimic. And they don’t have any of the best lines. Only Daddy Ray has the best lines.</p>

<p>I once saw Myrianna reach across a BroastCups table to grasp Jenna’s hand. I waited for Jenna to pull away, but to my great astonishment, she put her other hand on top of Myrianna’s, squeezed it hard, and curled forward in a delighted gasp. </p>

<p>One time, I answered the land line and Myrianna was on the other end, and she had THAT RAP MUSIC playing in the background. She was on a speakerphone, and from the watery way noise flowed in and out of the reverb, I imagined her in the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her thin body, her sunflower glistening. “Chad?” she reverbed. “Chad, can I talk to Jenna?”</p>

<p>Gabbling geese in the background.</p>

<p>“What?” I faked, “What’s that? Lotta reverb there! Need a better speakerphone, I think!” And sound like tiles popping off, shattering in time to a black-guy voice. I gave the phone to Jenna. I was curious about what would require a half-naked bathroom call from Myrianna. Jenna is a multi-room phone talker. Wandering from time to time to the kitchen for a glass of water was a good way to observe her. I looked for key evidence, body language. Rubbing the back of the head, buffing the nails, holding her forehead or her cheek, tickling one of her nostrils with a surreptitious pinky—these were all innocent enough, no cause for concern, but this time she was just standing there, silent for over a minute, breathless, tracing her middle finger from the base of her throat to the crook of her V-neck, then catching the fabric there and plying it between middle and ring finger, finally letting her hand slide down to rest on the swell of her hip, at the exact same location that, when touched by my own hand, makes her think I want sex. I noticed this behavior twice—noted that on the second occasion she nibbled on her bottom lip. What was Myrianna saying, in that moment? I would have given my whole collection of Le Chatte Exposé to know.</p>

<p>I don’t dislike Myrianna. But I think she treated her marriage and divorce too flippantly. Once she said getting married was like getting on a crowded subway car with a lot of shopping bags. You had to guard your bags from getting trounced, and guard yourself from getting fondled, and cover your nose against the smells, but once you got off, it was a kind of freedom you never had before you got on. Now, I’m fine with girl time, with clothing talk and makeup tips and household wisdom, but Jenna doesn’t need to hear Myrianna’s awful analogies. I was sitting on the ottoman when Myrianna delivered this particular gem, and I gauged Jenna’s reaction pretty carefully: her eyebrows went up, her lips compressed. And she glanced at me. Then she exploded with laughter—and turned the laughter to Myrianna, who also exploded into laughter. Fine, I thought. Laughter is a fine reaction. It’s what I would expect. Thoughtfulness: would not be a good sign. Sadness, bad. It was that quick glance at me, with her eyes twinkling and her mouth sealed and her eyebrows aloft that made me wonder. I suspect it was a look of love but the laughter was a mystery. A result of Myrianna’s ridiculous analogy? Or was it provoked by something else? I finally decided she was laughing at the gross inaccuracy of the thing, the flip dismissal of the sacred, lasting challenge of marriage, which, far from being a trainride from one El stop to the next, is more of a pleasant, wooded footpath to the grave. Or a car so fine it lasts you forever.</p>

<p>In Candlewood Green, houses are bought before they’re built. That means they’re brand-spanking new. And worry-free. No lead in the paint, no allergens in the ducts, no attics full of asbestos or garages full of mercury and teratogens. And no fiberglass insulation, only cellulose. No granulomas for us, thank you. The carpet of our new house is deep pile carpet. Synthetic fiber, but treated with a seal: a compromise. Jenna wanted wool carpet. Natural fiber, for Ethan’s sake. But I protested: did we really want to be walking around on the fur of some kind of farm animal? To be frank, wool stinks. One of the reasons we chose to live in a newer house was to avoid odors. Places with pet histories. That rich odor of salivating beasts. Moist little rat dogs, drooling hounds, Shetland ponies. Not to mention the smells left behind by the kind of people we didn’t even know. We couldn’t stomach older places. The advantage of buying a place in Candlewood Green was that we bought it before it was even built, so when we finally moved in, we felt like the first ones to breathe the air.</p>

<p>Why take chances if you don’t have to? It pays to be cautious when it comes to the air. There are things in older houses you just don’t want to expose an unborn or born child to, like lead in the paint, allergens in the ducts, attics and walls full of asbestos, garages full of mercury and teratogens. But with out new house, when we moved in, we couldn’t believe the freshness of the that new house smell. And we breathed it with a clear conscience. We knew all the paint was safe lead-free latex, and the walls had cellulose and not fiberglass insulation so none of us would get asthma or granulomas. The carpets had been treated with PureChoice carpet seal to reduce the outgassing of carcinogenic adhesive odors and teratogens like styrene. And they were not, I pointed out to a Jenna as pleased as I was by the freshness, wool. They would not, on humid days, smell like a donkey&#8217;s armpit (or whatever you&#8217;d call the corresponding area on a donkey).</p>

<p>It’s true that older houses have yards full of mature trees, giant things erupting against the sky that obscure you from the kind of scientific voyeurism and overzealous vigilance that good neighborhoods are known for. Nice, but not worth having a child with a withered arm or an evulsed belly. Besides, fat oaks and maples smother lawns. All that deep shade and branch detritus. We don’t want bald spots, not on our lawn. We had a Goldrain Nitro-irrigation system installed, so that come spring-through-fall it’s a lush, radiant green.</p>

<p>A sales rep at the PureChoice company pushed for wool carpet, harder than Jenna did. I had to ask Diane (the sales rep&#8217;s name) if it was only a coincidence that wool was also the most expensive option, at thirty-nine dollars a square foot. I told Jenna we had to remember our budget. She was constantly calling me at work to request things that were going to swell it. My exact words were: “Too thin, too rich. If we keep our budget thin, we stay rich.” She responded that wool was the only guaranteed non-carcinogenic carpet material. I said sure, unless you&#8217;re allergic to goats. She said, “Wool comes from sheep.”</p>

<p>“I know. Same difference.”</p>

<p>&quot;And anyway, the allergen is the dander, and it comes from skin, and wool carpet is not skin.”</p>

<p>I pointed out that dander could latch on to the wool when they were shaving the goat.</p>

<p>“Chad, come on. Think about it. Teratogens? Styrene is far worse than allergens. Can we please just consider this? At least for the carpet in Ethan’s room?”</p>

<p>So I called back Diane at PureChoice, to ask about the seal.</p>

<p>“Our natural fiber carpet,” she said, “Is chemical-free and dye-free, and it comes in different natural shades. It does not have adhesive backing or glue and it can be satisfactorily laid over a floor or subfloor by nailing around the edges.”</p>

<p>I said fine, okay. “The wool sounds great, maybe for one room. But I’m asking—”</p>

<p>“PureChoice carpet seal is non-toxic. It contains no alcohol, butyl ethers, ammonia, phosphates, caustics or acids.”</p>

<p>“Okay—”</p>

<p>“It’s non-flammable, odorless, dye-free, and biodegradable.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>“It does not irritate hands or skin.”</p>

<p>“But what’s in it? Just water?”</p>

<p>“The seal?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s not just water, but it’s very safe. The only thing you don’t want to do is use it on a wool carpet. I know you don’t want the wool, but just in case you did decide on it, you wouldn’t want to use this on it.”</p>

<p>I said: “So, it’s not safe for sheep but it’s okay for us?”</p>

<p>Silence, and then: “Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, just a joke. Did you say it contains no styrene, or it blocks no styrene?”</p>

<p>“It does block styrene. It blocks the worst carcinogens found in carpet backing like styrene, formaldehyde, xylene, toluene and benzene.”</p>

<p>“And all I have to do is reapply it every year?”</p>

<p>“Every year or every five cleanings, whichever comes first.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” I said. “You’ve sold me.”</p>

<p>“You’d like to go with wool?”</p>

<p>“No. You sold me on the sealant.”</p>

<p>I called Jenna back. Her voice was strained and full of urgency like she was sinking in quicksand. I asked if everything was okay and she said, “Yes, everything’s fine, what is it?”</p>

<p>I explained the solution. We could keep Ethan safe and save money doing it, I said. Through the phone I heard something clang and rattle (a KleenWipe pan being dropped in the sink?) and then: “What are you saying, Chad?”</p>

<p>I explained everything Diane had told me. I laughed. I said, “You wouldn’t believe the way this lady was pushing the wool. ‘Not over my eyes,’ I said.” I laughed again, and started to go into detail, but Jenna cut me off.</p>

<p>“You’re sick,” she said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’re sick. I can’t believe you would put our son in jeopardy to save a few dollars.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that makes me sick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does.”</p>

<p>And she started to cry.</p>

<p>When she cries on the phone, I find it difficult to hang up, and more difficult to say anything. I can only listen. Especially when I&#8217;m at work, as I was on that day. I leaned back in the webbing of my Byron Kazman chair and surveyed the armada of desks and workstations, the engineers staring raptly into the hulls of their monitors, the people crossing over from Operations carrying manila folders or fresh laserprints. I tried to keep my features composed in a look of mild bemusement plus smug distraction so that none of my coworkers would suspect anything was wrong, but none of the people ambling toward conference rooms or trudging back from the copier or restroom or water cooler seemed to care. They all looked slightly bored and withdrawn as if searching for their terminal at the airport. Their soundtrack was the severely downsampled sound of my wife’s braying, in one ear. I took a long drive that night, and it wasn’t even Sunday.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>That first winter in our new house, we both began to reflect upon how far we’d come by looking at exactly where we were. I won’t say we had arrived, because I knew the future had much in store. But that winter, we truly felt a sense of accomplishment. Our new couch, so plump, the sea-green Velvetouch fabric looking golf-course fresh. Above it, yes, the new family portrait, the first family portrait, me Jenna and Ethan seated against a bright white background, each of us impeccably groomed. Deceptively oleaginous, that portrait. Not actually an oil-painting, I told every one of our guests, but a studio photograph treated with a digital processing algorithm, part of a suite of very cool post-processing effects offered by Precious Times, in the mall. And we’d look from that portrait to the front picture window, at the view of our new neighborhood: the clean, rectilinear homes, the gently curved streets. The yard would be bright, covered in snow, the afternoon glistening. Long, thin icicles often hung from the eaves across the street, smaller ones draped the sticklike maple in our front yard. Our squat little arborvitae bushes along the walk were shrinkwrapped in ice, the dwarf spruces coated in snow. We felt safe, settled, snuggled firmly into the deep crust of the earth. But not disconnected. We could see the whole neighborhood, it seemed, through our new crystal clear picture windows. Our windows gave us the neighborhood on all sides, but our window to the whole world opened up the day we bought our big screen, a top-of-the-line plasma installed by a team of Mexican men. I instructed Miguel, Wili, Germán and Diego to situate the display so it faced our new family portrait directly across the living room. I wanted us to face the world, the world to face us, and our life to exist in between the two.</p>

<p>The Mexican men made Jenna nervous, especially Miguel, but they were only around for four hours. The result was worth it, truly wonderful: recessed mounting above the main fireplace, beautiful wood trim work around it, all of it executed with an invisible south-of-the-border touch. Most guests will only see an expert mount job, but we’ll always cherish the memory of the actual hard work that went into it. Those busy workers: Diego’s black tee-shirt, his red hat and thick mustache, Wili’s long hair, limp and inky, Miguel’s faded tee-shirt depicting the Cherry Boy cartoon character collecting Mr Dimtrap’s Darkness in a sock. And all of their hightop sneakers lined up by our front door. Only Jenna and I will know how hard those kids worked, in their socks, for us. And what a great result, with that screen perfectly in the center. Millions of pixels simulating motion at any given moment. Visions of reality meshed together temporally into a very pleasing kind of non-reality. It was constantly on, that winter, as a background to our lives, a panel of bright colors shifting softly, the sound turned off and the closed captioning showing us important breaking news dialogues and opinions as they happened. Joe Busterfield was a constant guest in our home. We could be talking about anything, about a Deucey’s sale, about fish sticks, about bean cakes (Jenna’s favorite), about Ethan’s head, and there he’d be, in a black suit, talking about THE MUSLIM FAITH, about THESE PEOPLE. I agree with his sentiments, completely. The closed-captioning may spell things differently, but it tells undeniable truths. The word MERSINARY, for example. The phrase FREE DUMB TO NOT BE BLOWN UP. These are important concerns. And they feel good to feel. They feel just right. Joe Busterfield, taking a caller, says JIHAD THAT MEANS HOLY WAR CHECK HER DICTIONARY. NEXT CALL HER.</p>

<p>It was a winter that whispered along like constant sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>We’ve come a long way. We’ve had hard times before, and we’ve gotten past them. Contrast the calm whiteness of that winter with the spicy, tequila-laced memories of that hot Spring Break we spent in Cancún. In which we encountered the first threats to our then-very-young relationship.</p>

<p>As custom would dictate on a Spring Break getaway, we had booked a sensibly cut-rate hotel room with a few other couples. One day Jenna and I were alone in the room while the others were out at the usual spot for rowdy drunken college kids, La Palapa Loca. They were probably all staring down the necks of limed Luz! Xtras while simultaneously screaming and holding Don Pepe tequila shooters in the air. But at that moment, I was watching my beautiful wife-to-be stroll nude from the bed to the bathroom, her pale buttocks flexing in the filtered Mexican sunlight from the vertical blinds. And I was about to make a comment I would regret for a long time.</p>

<p>She was standing in the bathroom doorway and messing with her hair in the mirror. Back then her hair was always ponytailed into a shimmering tassel midway down her back. It was honey-blond, her natural color, and it’s never been that long since. Or as soft. Her hair then was softer, I contended, than any other part of her, and I liked it, but then I’ve always liked her hair, even when the qualities of it change. By our senior year, it was above her shoulders, sculpted and dyed blond, like Karissa Pumpwissel’s hair, from Reality Housewives in Trouble. The dye-jobs were drying it out, making it stiff and spiky, and while it was still long enough to be pulled into a pseudo-ponytail that made her look like a cockatoo, I was learning to like it shorter anyway. After awhile, I just expected it to get shorter. Tighter, more controlled. Now I’ve come to like the short cropped look of it, the spiky, desiccated feel of it, the unruffleable bangs, the stiff roots. Especially at the nape, where it prickles my palm like astroturf. I like to run my fingers through it back there, feel where it gets bare, blends into the down of her neck. Nowadays, she likes to do the top part of it in a slight perm, but with bangs too, so on top it’s all curly and wavy and tapers just above the ears, and in front it’s poofy or curls down, and sometimes she puts something in it to make it spiky, like a dandelion. Actually, this is a popular style in Schaumburg, and I like it. At church I have a good idea of what it feels like to have my hands on the head of almost any woman in the place. That’s a good feeling, that familiarity. Comfort can be as refined as anything else. But church comfort is nothing compared to home comfort, to the thorough familiarity that I have with my own wife’s head. That kind of familiarity is very, very exciting in its own right, and it’s that familiarity that I was beginning to feel, there in Cancún, for her, for her hair. I watched avidly as she stood in the bathroom doorway and freed it, then pulled it taut over her small head (and she does have an extraordinarily small head), then passed it through a scrunchy that she proceeded to make occipitally snug. She walked to the foot of the bed and faced that mirror, the one everyone called the doggy style mirror, gave the tress a delicate flick-and-shake and then stood there long enough to contemplate her own nude frontside while affording me a wonder-full view of her rear end.</p>

<p>I chuckled, perhaps meanly, as I thought of our four roomies, undoubtedly still working their way through a bucket of beer at La Palapa Loca, watching fat girls shimmy on the mechanical bull. And I had this: a wonder-full time for me, and what suckers they were!</p>

<p>Jenna swiveled her shoulderblades to one side, then another. The ponytail stayed put between them, curled as if seeking heat, talon-like at its tip where it touched the innermost curve of her spine as lightly as its shadow lit there. I knew that—trained to a thorn-brown stylus after a twirl in her mouth—it could, and might be, used to great effect in tracing C-H-A-D on me from chest to navel before gliding even farther south to the waypost of a more tropical region. I knew this, and yet I was about to make my comment anyway.</p>

<p>For some reason, as she turned to come back to the bed, she was sticking her tum out more than usual. It wasn’t anything grotesque. She was, and still is, rail-thin, even with child. In fact, the twists and curves that I love about her come from various kinds of torsion, not anything as unsubtle as the symmetrical distension of womanly bulges.</p>

<p>So when I remarked on it, I was really remarking on what was probably only an effect of a curve of the spine. An effect that I was enjoying. It made me laugh as she clambered over me. I laughed, and she said “What is it,” and I laughed and said “Oh, nothing.” And she said, “No, what is it,” and I laughed and asked did she really want to know? and she said yes. So I pinched her last rib and told her, “Oh, nothing, I just like your little pig belly.”</p>

<p>The effect was immediate. Her face fell, she pushed herself away from me, a long way, it seemed, for the amount of time it took for her to crawl to the foot of the bed. She was surprisingly craven, like she was trying to crawl into herself, but didn’t want her rolls to show as she did it. And curled up like that, balanced on the precipice of hotel bed hugging her knees, which made the dreaded abdominal creases show anyway. </p>

<p>I sat up and, with a hurt tone, played tight D. I said it had only been a joke, a very innocent joke. She didn’t look at me or say anything, just extended her arm sideways and showed me her tiny fist with one delicate digit sticking straight up. I was silent. She, giving me the finger, and not as a joke. What could I say to that waypost?</p>

<p>It was a first, for sure. She had never flipped me the bird before, and she has not done it since. We were both silent. In my memory, I hear waves crashing, but I know it was only the air conditioner.</p>

<p>We lapsed into the kind of conversation I’ve always dreaded. Feelings were discussed extensively. It lasted until a chill settled into the room. It outlasted the goosebumps. It lasted beyond the knock on the window, lasted through giggles outside signaling our turn was over, lasted through her wiggling herself back into her bikini. It lasted, in one form or another and punctuated by changes of subject, silences, brief absences from one another and her flirtation with a Pike from Ohio State who, believe it or not, had a fyborg arm, a tube of steel rods with a claw at the end of it (not to be confused with anything cyborg-related, which would be much more formidable). It lasted into the next week, as we returned to classes with the hangovers of seven hangovers. It lasted beyond that week.</p>

<p>In retrospect, maybe the One-Arm Buckeye fyborg was only a foil. He was the cover-up for someone else’s chance to be Mr. Sensitive Understanding-Just-Let-Me-Hold-You for a devastated Jenna. And devastated by what? By my innocent comment alone?</p>

<p>The first week of classes after Spring Break, Jenna told me she’d begun studying with someone named Nick Scintilla. She claimed she’d met him in her Acc’y class, but funnily enough, she only began studying with him after Spring Break.</p>

<p>She called it a “chillout period.” Whatever it was, it was marked by considerable cooling trends. I behaved impeccably, followed the prescribed rules for doghouse status, and buried my jealousy deep in the yard. It was okay, we had decided, to see other people, so I did. I went to a barn dance with a Kappa and that evening is another story entirely, but it involved her, a bottle of Fropp’s Schnapps and two other guys from the house and one very ugly phone conversation the next day.</p>

<p>She never said she was dating this Scintilla guy. She never said they did anything besides study together at the undergrad library. In fact, after finals that year, I didn’t hear his name for a long time. But I think he was there. In our junior and senior years, we had an apartment together. It would have been hard to hide secrets. We saw more of each other, and more of each other at our worst. One day she started wearing a well-used baseball cap to study in. It just appeared one day. She said she got it from one of her sorority sisters, but wouldn’t specify which one. The oddest thing, apart from the fact that the only billed cap I’d ever seen her wear was a Tammy Dill khaki with her sorority letters on it, was that on the front of this hat was a marijuana leaf.</p>

<p>This, I thought, was her worst. I was seeing her at her worst, for sure. That’s what happens when people live together. The best and the worst. And we had to love both.</p>

<p>She said it was a Japanese Maple leaf. I told her, adopting a hyper-sarcastic tone and nodding a little too emphatically: “Yeah, rrright. Uh, sure.”</p>

<p>In those days, pot leaves were all over campus apparel, and this, I could see, was no Japanese Maple. The hat was obviously well-worn before she got it. Sweated in. Rimy with salt fractals along its frayed edges. Dry lakes sweated there by some poorly hydrated dude, someone perhaps with a Mary Jane addiction compelled to eat unhealthy amounts of sodium-heavy snack foods. Someone who, if they pushed a hat like this on her, could push anything on her. She even wore it backwards. I had never seen her do this, even with her Tammy Dill hat, which was a hat notoriously worn backwards by college girls during that era of fashion history. I told her she looked like she was from downstate or something, but even that low blow didn’t seem to bother her. She didn’t care how it made her look, just wanted to wear it.</p>

<p>One day it fell out of our third story window, into the dumpster. With a guilty face I told her about it. I was arranging the windowsill, I told her, with the favorite knick-knacks she had recently begun collecting (painted wooden fish). I was just arranging the wooden fishies on the sill, and it just, sort of, fell.</p>

<p>“Oh really,” she said, not seeming to care one way or the other.</p>

<p>I fidgeted, wondering if I should go down there and retrieve the thing. Then, about ten minutes of silence later, as she hunched over a densely paginated Acc’y book, with her hair looking like a sun-parched herbaceous spot-shrub, she said, “Actually I’m glad.”</p>

<p>I stopped fidgeting. She said, “I was trying to figure out how to get rid of it anyway,” and I released my breath.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but it seemed like a major victory. It was just a crappy hat. But the way she seemed to accept it, as if it was something major, made me think.</p>

<p>She only mentioned it one other time. It was after we bought the first house, when she really got into gardening. When she started growing all this grass. Not the kind of grass that Renaldo likes, the kind the Indians used to ride through, Illinois prairie grass. She’s crazy for the stuff. Has this plot along the sidewalk, across the front of our lawn, from the small maple to our mailbox enclosure. Meticulously transplanted this, grass by grass, from the old place. This is Turkey Foot. That is Heavy Metal. This? Know a weed when I see it. (Broadleaf?) This is called Beard of Jesu. This is Widow’s Broom. This is False Aster. This is Doll Rake. This is Canadian Throttleweed. This is Prairie Shockdaw. This is Ragged Pinkslip. That Turkey Foot is one ugly grass. It really looks like a turkey’s foot. And Yucca, Day Lilies, Irises. I’m not sure those last three are grasses, but it doesn’t matter to her. She likes the blades. She loves all of them. She was painstakingly digging these things up when we moved. She had them in these blue mesh bags, in a flat bottom wheelbarrow, and she was fretting over each of them like they were towheaded children. I half expected her to comb them.</p>

<p>Anyway, when she started up with the grass, she said she wished she had that old gardening cap she used to study in.</p>

<p>“Which one was that?” I asked, pretending not to know.</p>

<p>“You know, that one I had for awhile. I was really into that one, for awhile.”</p>

<p>Her face got a distant, musing look. It was almost a look I’d seen once while she was in the bed, trying to pleasure herself with her hand, which never quite seems to work.</p>

<p>“Those were the days,” she said. </p>

<p>I made a joke about her needing to grow a different kind of grass if she wore another hat like that. She didn’t laugh, but we both understood something right then and there. We’d passed through the gauntlet.</p>

<p>Although she’d most certainly had an affair with Scintilla the pot-head study buddy, and fucked a fyborg too.</p>

<p>I asked her about it once. I had to. It was during a little disagreement we were having that had escalated into shouting and tossing magazines. Finally when it was my turn to shout again, I tossed a magazine and shouted: “Did you fuck the fyborg guy too?”</p>

<p>She shouted: “What the fuck is a fyborg?”</p>

<p>I shouted: “The guy with the metal arm. Did you fuck him?”</p>

<p>Of course, I didn’t get an answer, but I could tell—from the way she proceeded to tell me how ridiculous it was that I would ask, in such an offensive way, about something that might have happened before we were even married—I could see that the answer was indeed yes.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>It’s the times when my wife is at her weakest that I admire her strength the most. Even if sometimes that strength is turned against me. Even then, it’s her weakness that provokes it. It instills confidence, that strength-from-weakness. I know that outside of the safe shelter of family and home, she can fend for herself. And she does. You can never tell what a woman will be up against when it comes to the modern workplace. Still dominated today by men and their needs, and hard surfaces, corners, and closed office doors. As a woman in a world of men, Jenna needs to be strong. And she is. Remarkably so.</p>

<p>Once, when she still worked at Arlensin in the Loop, she was attacked, and I wasn’t there to help. It is shocking to think about, but it happened. And it happened in a place known to amp female apprehension to peak levels: a parking garage.</p>

<p>The details she remembers, like the ones that have now stuck in my mind, are grotesque. Her attacker was a friend of a coworker’s who walked her to her car under the pretense of safety. He was an unshaven man with a torso shaped like a bean, wearing one of those Mexican weave pullovers, with ripped jeans and red shoes (yes—red shoes!), and he had a hunching posture that made his head, at arms length, appear to float in front of his shoulders. When he was holding her against a car, he kept saying “Mmm, listen to my touch. Mmmmmmmmm&#8230; .” and similar variations on that theme. He kept calling her “mama” too—and also “little girl”—and probably “baby” as well. I understand, television stereotypes come to mind with these details, but these are things he really said, as they say on TV, “in the heat of the moment.”</p>

<p>She had been late to work that day (my fault—I had begged her to fix me a haystack, an all-beef patty topped with hashbrowns and gravy—before she got ready for work), and she hadn’t been able to get a spot in the usual garage. She had to park in the other direction, several blocks away.</p>

<p>She met him at a not-so-private Arlensin Accounting party at Señor Castaneda’s on Dearborn. Her coworker, Fat Greta (as Jenna calls her, but not to her face), told her his name was Chip with two P’s. Chip with two P’s explained the totally weird circumstantial encounter with Fat Greta that day at lunch. He was just passing through the city on his way to Leadville (over in Colorado), when he ran into Greta at the old Squeeze Freeze and she told him to stop by Señor Castaneda’s tonight for some Arlensin-supplied drinksies. And &#8230; well, here he was. “Wow, it’s been so long,” Fat Greta kept saying, drunk only thirty minutes into the function. It came out that Chipp and Greta used to date. Way back when, at the University. Same school Jenna and I went to. It even turned out they had mutual acquaintances from the sorority scene, Tri-Delts, just like Jenna. He even knew Jenna’s pledge mom. He seemed like a normal enough guy. The only indication he was weird came after several Xtra Lights when he said, “Can I just tell you somethin. Can I. You’ve got &#8230; some very sexy ears.” “Ears?” Jenna said. “Yeah,” he said. “Ears.” It made her laugh. And, he said, while he was on it, she had the sexiest canals he’d ever seen too. Then he promised not to say canals anymore. He said all he meant to say was that she had sexy ears and he’d like to touch them. If he could touch them, he said, he promised he wouldn’t slip a pinky in. He said the crest of the ear was called the helix and the thing he promised not to say anymore was called the auditory meatus. He said the helix often had a downy soft pelt of invisible hair. He was standing really close, Jenna said. Too close. His lips had started to do this rigid sphinctering thing, like they were sucking on an invisible straw. At that point it seemed like a tic, not a warning sign. She started a speech about how she didn’t normally let strange men touch her ears. He interrupted her, in a real jokey way, said: “Not just touch. I’d like to pinch onto a helix with each hand and feel the dual heat. I wanna feel the dual meatus heat. Sweet heat from your meatuses.” And he laughed, hard, and jovially, as if that might make her okay with it.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, Jenna has come into contact with much stranger people at Arlensin. Still, Jenna doesn’t respond well to freaks. Instead of razzing him or icing him like she should have (like I would have), she only shrugged. I asked if it was a smiling shrug or some other kind of shrug, and she said there was no other kind of shrug. Could this have done anything but encourage him? It’s easy to imagine a shrug being the warmest response this guy had ever gotten. Then he said, “I’ll just grab on, like this,” and he set his beer down, pinched both her earlobes, and shook her head back and forth. No, shake is the wrong word, she said. It was very gentle. It didn’t hurt. In fact, it made her laugh. Not giggle, but laugh.</p>

<p>“I’d grab those ears from front or back,” he said, letting go. Then he picked up his beer. “I’m just playin around. I’m a sucker for sexy ears.”</p>

<p>Jenna always says: “He was embarrassed. His face got all red. That’s why I wasn’t worried.”</p>

<p>The conversation kept flopping back to mutual acquaintances. Old haunts at the U. His occasional regression to his ear infatuation was not a creepy but a charming quirk. He reminded her, she said, of a boy from camp, who played the trumpet and also had a special affection for ears, for her ears especially. That boy used to release the spit valve on his horn and say, “Look, Jenna, look, I’m thinking of you,” as a silky strand of goo stretched its way to the floor. At that, she said, she also shrugged. She didn’t act grossed out. But she never said she liked it. Jenna doesn’t encourage pervs, but she seems to attract them, and though she denies it, I think if they’re harmless, she kind of likes them.</p>

<p>Around eight the party wound down. He offered to walk her. Fat Greta came up under the light of a pink neon taco. She offered to give Jenna a ride to the other parking garage (“Chipp, you should totally come too!”), and Jenna thought, these are the options. Go with Fat Greta, who has wriggled her way out of not one but two DUIs, only by the grace of the steamroller help of her Daley machine connections. Or let Chip with two P’s be alone with her and her tempting ears. Or walk herself, and be a target for someone crazier than either one of them. Snap decision. What would Jenna do?</p>

<p>She decided to walk herself.</p>

<p>“I parked that way too!” Chipp said.</p>

<p>Jenna said Greta plowed her tits into him. With what I imagine was a lot of heat, she said she’d give them both a ride, no problem. Chipp declined. He insisted on accompanying Jenna. Jenna declined. She walked away. Chipp started walking with her, saying he remembered this one Tri-Delt barn dance, when the police showed up and some new pledge punched one of them. “I was there!” Jenna said, and they launched into a comforting conversation. By the time they got to the first stoplight, she felt safe. She felt safe all the way to the big lit DAYPARK sign. They came into the parking garage. “Well,” she said, “Thanks.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, “I’ll make sure you get to your car.” Okay. The conversation stopped. She heard his breath. He was looking at her, at the side of her face, while they walked. She thought she felt him gazing into her ear canal. This was when, she said, she got the first thrill of fear. She had spotted the truck. She quickened her pace. He was still staring at the side of her head, and without turning, she asked what he was looking at. She was hoping to un-nerve him. “Oh, my god,” he said. “I was just thinking. You know, the ear &#8230; is such an intimate organ. I think it’s the most intimate of all. Not what most people think, huh? But how intimate is what we hear? How intimate is someone’s voice? Isn’t it crazy that we live in a world where women walk around with their ears exposed all the time? I mean, I get glimpses every day. I can be in line at the bus stop and see the most intimate part of every woman’s body. It’s flagrant. Totally flagrant. I can look as much as I want. I can look right down the meatus if I want. I can stare at women’s ears all day, and they’re unashamed. It kind of drives me nuts, you know? Makes me feel a little crazy. Those complicated little &#8230; intertwined ridges &#8230; little hairs, the auditory meatus &#8230; hey—”</p>

<p>This was when he grabbed her, by one arm, pushed her between two vehicles, faced her into a car. He hung his head close and whispered—”Do you like to have your ears touched, little girl?”</p>

<p>She insists it was not as weird as it sounds. She didn’t think he had planned to make this move behind the largest vehicle in the place, a black truck designed after a military transport vehicle, where they would be blocked from the view of anyone entering the parking level at the other end. She didn’t think he meant harm. So she let him whisper. “Do you like to have them caressed?” When she first told me the story, she said she told him yes, she did like that—also in a whisper she said this—and when I became outraged, she revised the story.</p>

<p>It was the second such outburst I’d had at hearing the story, and I resolved to avoid further objections, just so she wouldn’t revise any other important details. In her now-revised version, instead of whispering back, she immediately began to struggle. I like that version better.</p>

<p>Chipp was smiling, in a friendly way, as he spoke. During the pauses in the more rapaciously frenzied expressions of his desire, his mouth formed a sphinctered pink hole, close enough to her face to allow her a glimpse of his pointy tongue which in the moist beery darkness was flailing back and forth like an injured worm. He sucked in his breath around it with a modulated hiss. <em>Thwa Thwa Thwa Thwa.</em> Jenna said later that she believed this was some trick of hypnosis. That it kept her mesmerized. He was like one of those snake charmers, she said, what are they called: a faker. He’d get the tongue flailing in the audible suck of air, and then he’d ease up. Good-cop/bad-cop. “Ah, I’m just jokin,” and his face would straighten, but only for a second. “Just fuckin around, Jenna. Man, it was so cool to meet you, Jenna. Oooh. Mmm. Mmmm, my god, mama, let me pet your ear. Mmmm, yeah”— <em>Thwa Thwa Thwa Thwa</em> —”Come on, mama, let me, come on, listen. Listen to my touch. Oooh, yeah, little girl, listen to me. LISTEN!!”</p>

<p>There was some moment she feels bad about, somewhere in there, between his snake charming and what happened next, where she actually thought maybe she should go along with it. She hadn’t found him unattractive, and she’d enjoyed talking to him. Guys got weird when they were turned on. Maybe, she said, she thought, maybe, and then no, then he was gripping her harder, by the ears, holding her against that car, with that big shiny black military vehicle behind him. Maybe not what she thought it could be. Her hands were free. She started hunting through her purse.</p>

<p>“Just let me get some protection,” she said. He straightened, let her arm go. “What?”</p>

<p>I think this was also my exact reaction when she told the story.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” She pulled the pin from a small canister and held it up, its tiny hole aimed at his puzzled face. Totally perplexed, he was. Like he didn’t see this coming. “What is it?” he said. “A condom?” His confusion was perfect. It was so perfect it made him take a step back. It was perfect for her too. She didn’t want to catch any blowback. That kind of spray is not strictly legal in the state of Illinois. It is legal in Wisconsin, which in my book of things my wife should be allowed to protect herself with is close enough geographically to make it ethical. Granted, it’s only legal for officers of the law, but her cousin’s husband happens to be one, and that’s a family connection that, in a city run by nepotism, is a perfectly acceptable line of distribution. This kind of capsicum spray, which from that day on, she has carried (but, God bless, never had to use again), is called Hott Stopper. It has a Scoville heat rating in the millions, and comes in a convenient 1.5 oz size. She didn’t stay around long enough to see what it did to Chipp’s face. Or his eyes or the tender tips of own ears. Suffice it to say Señor Castaneda’s Flaming Hot Salsa has nothing on the concoction in this particular personal-defense unit. You could rub a habañero on your own eyeball and you would be experiencing about a third of the heat of this stuff. </p>

<p>“Chad,” she later confided. “I was so scared there.”</p>

<p>In a soft voice, barely audible to anyone, I offered words of comfort.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “You don&#8217;t understand. I wasn’t scared of what he might do. I was scared of what <em>I</em> might do.”</p>

<p>I laughed at that, at what was clearly her confusion. I told her she did exactly what she needed to do, and then she got the rock outta there. What else could she have done?</p>

<p>She looked at me then and I could see the fear. I’d seen it before: in college she said she was afraid to leave me, ever. That the world scared her, that she couldn&#8217;t stand the thought of an unknown life. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a bit of heroic satisfaction at that: she was afraid to leave my embrace. She had corrected me on that occasion, said no, she wasn’t afraid to leave my embrace, that embrace wasn’t the right word. “You just mean something comforting and familiar,” I’d said. And she didn’t deny it. “Something like that,” she said. “I’ve just had &#8230; bad experiences, you know. I just know there are bad things out there. And I need to trust someone for something. Even if it can&#8217;t be for everything.”</p>

<p>So when I saw that kind of fear again, in her eyes, I smiled. I told her she was a survivor, and her actions defending herself against Chipp with two Ps proved that. But she got more frustrated, and said, “No, no, you don&#8217;t understand, Chad. I was afraid, but not of what could have happened. I was afraid of what <em>didn’t</em> happen. Not only did I not trust myself with his &#8230; overtures &#8230; but after I sprayed him, after I looked down on his pitiful state, rolling around with his fists balled up into his eyes, and he was screaming. Oh, he was screaming so frickin loud, Chad. And I felt—“</p>

<p>“You felt bad for him,” I said.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t feel bad for him at all! I felt like maybe it wasn’t enough. I looked down on him like that and I thought of several other things I could do to him right then and there. He seemed so helpless. I suddenly had the chance to do whatever I wanted. I imagined doing things to him that are &#8230; sick.”</p>

<p>And then she fell into my arms weeping. I gave her tender caresses along her dry strawlike hair and whispered soothing trifles. And between sobs she went into detail about the things she wanted to do to him. And they were bad, I&#8217;ll admit, but I did chuckle at them. In the shock of retelling the whole thing, I&#8217;m sure it helped to say exactly what her intense fear had made her think. But it was pretty awful stuff. “It&#8217;s okay,” I told her. “It&#8217;s okay.”</p>

<p>“No, it&#8217;s not!” she yelled, wrenching herself free and punching my chest. Her face was streaked and bright pink. “You don&#8217;t understand! One minute I was like &#8230; into letting this guy &#8230; get oral sex from me or something, and the next I wanted to slice his vas deferens up with that Japanese knife we got from your dad last Christmas! I don&#8217;t even know who I am!”</p>

<p>My hands dropped to my sides, and she crumpled.</p>

<p>What could I say or do? I had nothing then, and it was one of those moments, from time to time, when neither one of us had anything, not even each other.</p>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<h3>BUBBLE GIRLS</h3>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<p>Donald had a real fishy way about him: a kelplike gait, and he wore turtlenecks. You can’t trust anyone in a turtleneck. Turtlenecks rank right up there with goatees and flip-flops as a sure sign of an untrustworthy hombre. From day one, the turtlenecks told me a lot. And his fishy manner, the way he walked like an underwater plant. The way he crossed his legs like a professor, an affectation if I ever saw one, a pedagogy of buttock girth. That’s the kind of man he is: one who crosses his legs in a way that maximizes the spreading of his buttock. The kind of man who only crosses his legs this way when you decide to talk about something besides birds and paper. The kind of man who responds to off-topic conversation by saying: Really, well, hmm, but take for example MY ASS. Yes, here is one side of it, stretched to the MAX. What do you think? I’m showing it to you right now by crossing my legs in a very effeminate manner, and until you cease being off-topic with me, I will avoid all eye contact and stare at your wife, and most importantly, I will force you to witness my out-thrust and extremely stretched buttock the whole time.</p>

<p>He’s originally from Vermont, which figures. And although we never really hit it off, at least with him around I could turn away from the kind of mind-meld that happened whenever Jenna and Myrianna sat caddy-corner to each other. “Are they going to mount each other, or what?” Donald would angle, and I’d counter, “I think they’re locked in for an asynchronous data dump,” and no matter how subtle we were, they’d notice. The oblivion was only an illusion.</p>

<p>Donald once told me there was no way I could ever understand the joy of bird-watching. He said “You have to immerse yourself in the canopies for days on end to understand, Chad. It’s all about the degrees of variation found in familiarity. You can’t understand nuance until you find your terra firma.”</p>

<p>I didn’t ridicule him, not out loud at least. I just listened. I do not appreciate people telling me what I can and can’t understand, especially using phrases like “terra firma.” But I was laudably polite to him. What he said was, I’ll admit, somewhat interesting. He had this story about seeing a flock of Bohemian Waxwings in Windermere, swooping in on a swarm of grasshoppers, in the rain. I was gracious. I admitted I did not know Windermere was in the Lake District of England. I also very graciously admitted I did not know that it was the only place in the world where (and yes, he actually said this) where sheep truly belong to the aviary domain, like clouds do.
I granted that the confluence of rain, grasshoppers and birds must have been amazing, for him personally.</p>

<p>Like clouds do! What a jagoff! A flock of waxwings going after a swarm of grasshoppers. In the rain! And the grasshoppers—he kept calling them grassdaddies—leaping adolescently into the air right into open beaks as the flock swooped low over the delicately rain-beaded slender blades. Swooping, diving, switching direction fast, all at once—waxwings, the beauty!</p>

<p>“Oh, the waxwing,” he said. “Let me tell you about this bird.”</p>

<p>And let him I did.</p>

<p>“The bohemian variety is usually grey with colorful wingtips—black, red, yellow. Most waxwings have a bandit mask on their eyes, and they appear to have goatees, so they’re basically very cool-looking dudes.”</p>

<p>Cool looking dudes!</p>

<p>“And,” he said, “They’re essentially vegetarians.”</p>

<p>“Vegetarians don’t eat grasshoppers,” I pointed out.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he said. “Eat mostly fruit and berries.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but you heard what I just said, right?”</p>

<p>He laughed, as if at some thought in his own head rather than my troubling observation of his glaring plot hole. “Well, of course my first thought was: Why is the noble Waxwing, known for its peaceful nature, attacking those grasshoppers?”</p>

<p>“Right, that’s the point I’m making too.”</p>

<p>“I mean, it can’t be a food source. So what else might be going on? Now I was intrigued.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” I lied.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s why I was so surprised! It was very extraordinary behavior I was witnessing from my perch on that mossy berm—very extraordinary! This behavior was very much out of character! Not only is the waxwing a vegetarian—a vegan, if you will—but as a species they are notorious for sharing their food with each other. Yes, groups of them will pass a berry around from beak to beak before one of them eats it, and this way, the hungriest get fed first!”</p>

<p>“Or the greediest,” I pointed out.</p>

<p>He finished his little story with a twist, and as much as the main part of the story made me nauseous, and as much as the story didn’t really seem like a story at all, every story should have a twist. Midnight Shaman, for example, the successful writer of top-grossing screenplays, knows how to write twists into his work. Good ones too. The Night Shaman twists the very cloth of reality, those layered gauzy curtains we see the world through dimly, tweaks the left and right nipples of mankind, one, then the other, repeatedly, creating shifting patterns of folds upon folds. I had to give Donald credit for the twist in his own tale. It was this:</p>

<p>The birds finally all flocked over to the tree he was sitting under. This in itself was another surprise, a chance encounter up close. They perched in the branches above him. Then, turning the binocs on them, he saw that they weren’t holding grasshoppers in their beaks at all. No. Almost every one of them was clasping a delicate berry in its little bird snapper. At that moment in the tale, like a hero divulging all the information withheld in the first 80 minutes of a movie, he crowed: “So they <em>were</em> vegans after all! As I watched, berries were passed to the ones that hadn’t scored, and passed back to the ones that had, and so forth, until all the berries had been eaten.”</p>

<p>The only explanation for what he’d seen was that he hadn’t seen it close enough. Those grasshoppers hadn’t jumped to their deaths, they just happened to leap because they were scared senseless. In fact, the birds didn’t harm a single grasshopper, they <em>cleverly plucked the berries from underneath them</em>.</p>

<p><em>Waxwings, swooping, diving, switching direction fast!</em></p>

<p>He said he went back to the States after that most exciting birding expedition, and one of the first things he had to do was go down to the polling place. Said right after he voted, he looked at his ballot, then down at the floor of the church basement, and for a second he had a little flashback. He called it that—a little flashback. He thought the constellation of white paper dots changed direction several times, too quickly to be certain. Of course, it wasn’t moving at all. Then he had this deep, disgustingly emotional realization. He called it an epiphany. I said of course I know what an epiphany is. I always know when someone is telling a story with an epiphany in it because they pause, with bated breath, and say, tremulously, “and just then &#8230;”</p>

<p>And just then, he realized that the fate of those little pips was to be swept into a dustbin and forgotten, and what really mattered were the little holes the pips had left behind. Those would be counted, and those would decide things.</p>

<p>I did not ridicule him even on this ridiculous epilogue. I smiled graciously and thanked him for his wise anecdote. I said he certainly did march to his own drummer. Never would have connected those things. Points for originality. And then I repeated that phrase: points for originality, Donald. Bravo.</p>

<p>Perhaps Donald just never liked me. Better to say that he never understood me. Once I quite genuinely complimented him on his worldliness. I said I thought he had a worldly way about him and I admired him for keeping up that &#8230; essence. I said essence, but I meant pretense. And he was a bit too self-congratulatory about it. About that completely genuine compliment. “It is,” he said. “An essence. A completely essential part of me. I engage with the world, that’s who I am.”</p>

<p>At that point, feeling nauseous, I had to correct myself. I admired him for keeping up that pretense, I said, not essence.</p>

<p>“You first said essence,” he said, winking. “And I think you meant it.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I meant pretense.”</p>

<p>For awhile, I played ultimate frisbee with him and his friends from the museum. I played regularly, until Donald accused me of showboating. Apparently he didn’t care for the little SuperBowl Shuffle moves I did whenever I scored. Sometimes I did a Mike Singletary move, like a smug little nod—uh huh, wink, wink—and sometimes I did a Fridge move, nod and point, nod and point. For some reason these moves got Donald riled up, and one day he made a big issue out of it. Turned out he had rallied a few others against me, and a bunch of them confronted me. I asked them all point blank: wasn’t it my right to showboat? They all said no, that it was poor sportsmanship, and I said, “Hey if I score on you guys, I’ve earned the right to be a poor sportsman. You know what? I quit. How do you all like that? I’m just not going to play anymore.” And I quit for good that time.</p>

<p>On another occasion, I made a remark about Myrianna’s Chinese Calendar that set him on edge for some reason. He wouldn’t say anything in opposition, but he began staring intently at Jenna’s left thigh. To draw him out, I added that Orientals always seemed to have some ancient system for everything. Sure enough, he bristled up and said Oriental referred to place, not race, to which I said, “but aren’t all Orientals from a certain place—a place called the Orient?” To which he said, bristling even more, “It’s offensive to Asians.” To which I said, “Ah so, Kung Fu Donald say ching chong do battle for Chinaman.” And I caught him off guard with that. He actually laughed.</p>

<p>I said: “If you’re so PC, why would you laugh at that?” and he said, “Chad, Chad, Chad, I’m not laughing with you.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t say he was laughing at me. He just kept laughing. </p>

<p>When Donald laughed, he really did it. I have to give him that. He didn’t laugh easily, but when he did, it was genuine and raucous. It also always went on a little too long. He had a high-pitched laugh, insistent and grating in its repetitions. He laughed like a strident whore on some kind of club drug. Not one of those club drugs you hear about in date rapes, but one of those pep drugs, the ones that pick you up, derange your senses and sap your electrolytes. It disgusted me to hear him laugh, especially when he did it while crossing his legs that way he did.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as we stood on the patio that day, he couldn’t give me the ass. He merely turned away from me, making it clear that this was a solo laugh, not to be shared, especially not with me. Same difference though. Myrianna and Jenna had their hands on each others’ knees, squealing in unison.</p>

<p>While Renaldo’s face goes through contortions of desire for the Aussie bartendress, I cast my eye—insouciantly, I hope—across the gradually filling bar area. The ambient volume has reached a new high, encouraged by a chorus of competitively-pitched and raised voices and unintentionally shrill giggles, those coming mainly from a gaggle of pantsuited young women, their freshly manicured hands holding signature cocktails like accessories or smoking guns.</p>

<p>Two guys in blue suits order cocktails and talk about Julia’s rear while she mixes.</p>

<p>“Anytime I take a train, I ride the caboose,” one says.</p>

<p>“I like the dining car,” the other says. “You know, car number 69?”</p>

<p>Renaldo is watching them carefully.</p>

<p>When Julia sets their drinks down, one of them smiles at her a little too long. He asks her name, and she tells him. Then he asks her, “You from South Africa?”</p>

<p>She says yes.</p>

<p>“Whereabouts in South Africa?”</p>

<p>“Guess he’s not that good with accents,” I tell Renaldo.</p>

<p>“Praetoria,” she tells him.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he says, “I lived in Johannesburg for two years.”</p>

<p>“Is it? What did you there?” she asks.</p>

<p>The guy tells her he was working for Lazarette’s, as an Acquisitions Manager for the South African headquarters. His face is pink, clean-shaven, his eyes blue, and I don’t like him. But Julia, our Julia, Renaldo’s Julia, brightens, smiles, says really, she knew someone who worked in that office.</p>

<p>“Oh”—the guy’s nodding—”You did, did you? What was the guy’s name?”</p>

<p>“He got sacked,” she says, “For insubordination.”</p>

<p>The guy’s friend is scanning the bar area while he sips.</p>

<p>“Ah,” the guy says, and nods, with supreme buttholey confidence: “Guy sure didn’t work in my division then.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” the guy says, says no, no, he never saw anyone get sacked the whole time he was there.</p>

<p>“Yeah, sure,” I say.</p>

<p>Julia asks does he still work for them and he tells her yeah, he does, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Oh, great. Oh, yeah, sure you do. Oh, based in New York now, great, just here for an auction, yeah. Uh-huh. Started tonight, as a matter of fact. Lot of money floating around there. Young entrepreneurs, lot of important, lonely people. Invite only, but he can get people on the list.</p>

<p>“So,” he says, resting his chin on his hand. “What time you get off work, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Four,” Julia says. He gives her a wink, and she smiles.</p>

<p>The TV closed captioning says: KAMIKAZE TACK TICKS WHILE FORBID BUBBLE ALSO HAD A FOUR BIG BUBBLE FLAW / WHICH WAS THAT THEY IGNORED A REVERSAL TRUTH / AND YOU COULD CALL IT NOT YOURS TRUTH THAT THE FREE FIGHT HARD HER THAN THE OPPRESSED / AND THAT FREEDOM WILL OUT WILL AND OUT WITH HERE.</p>

<p>Renaldo watches the two blue suits walk away and sit down at one of the tables in the bar. They sit with their legs spread wide, arms propped up on the backs of their chairs, looking around for other women.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that asshole,” Renaldo says.</p>

<p>It’s the first thing he’s said to me since he told me about his mother being sick. And for once, I concur.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I’ll admit that I was not the most Neutral Buddy. I can admit that. I did pry, and I did a lot of asking why. And I have been known to sigh. And it’s a fact that my behavior became noticeably (yes, people noticed—noticeably they noticed) less neutral when Renaldo was hired. I’m not surprised that, in so many words, he said that he’d never liked me. But that he actually called me a dick — now, that was surprising. I never did anything dickish to him. Never did anything but try to be his friend, a true buddy, not just another spindle. I was willing to transgress my own policy, because as much as I hate to admit it, I like Renaldo. Everyone did. He’s just a very likable guy. It shouldn’t matter what he calls me, but it does. I like the guy. All disagreements aside, I like him.</p>

<p>I like him, but I shouldn’t. From the very first product meeting we were in, he seemed intent on challenging or discrediting me. Which wasn’t necessary at those meetings, because we made it clear the playing field was as level as it could be. And it’s true: that first meeting is key evidence in my defense.</p>

<p>It was the kickoff meeting for the enhancements to the hashcrypting engine. Torvin was there, and so was Tony. And so were ten or twelve others. And Renaldo was late.</p>

<p>At NDC it was crucial for everyone’s voice to be heard. I might have been CTO, but I was no censor. What a talented group of people we had there! Most product meetings involved the whole technical team, and there was no other way it could have been. Unfortunately, this meant waiting on a trickle of people that came fast or slow depending on the day of the week and the number of open bugs.</p>

<p>Still, on that day, there was no reason for Renaldo to be late.</p>

<p>So we were waiting. And with that group, for some reason, I always found waiting to be one of the most painful workplace endeavors.</p>

<p>Torvin was staring into his laptop like he was about to climb on top of it and writhe. He seemed aware of the others only as vague potential distractions. Tony was barefoot, scanning the wall table for a suitable perch. He liked to sit Indian-style on the highest place he could find, with his dirty toes flailing at everyone’s heads. Luckily the long tables along the conference room walls were always slightly taller than the conference table itself or one of us would be eye-to-toe with him. Tony is one of those tiptoe-walkers. A natural tip-toer. So he was tippy-toeing barefoot, looking for his perch. And Manny was there, Mexican Manny, and he was barefoot too. He was maneuvering his remote control dune-buggy around table legs, trying to drive it over Tony’s tiptoeing feet, which didn’t seem to bother Tony at all.</p>

<p>I ignored all of them and started to write on the whiteboard. </p>

<p>When Tony found his spot, I announced that we should get started here, don’t you think guys, good idea? okay? and Torvin looked up with a blank face and blinked at me, and Tony said, “We’re still waiting on Renaldo,” and Manny said nothing but his dune buggy started an aggressive ramming campaign on my right foot. It had enough torque in it to be painful. I know that sounds ridiculous, but I have sensitive feet, and believe it or not, a remote-control Dune Buggy ramming them at full speed can really cause discomfort. Worse, Manny was giggling like a demented mechanical bull operator. And that was painful in its own way, to hear and to see. I wanted to give his toy a sharp kick and put it out of commission, but with utmost restraint, I asked him kindly to please cut it out, for the sake of my sensitive feet.</p>

<p>“You’re in the way,” he said, and giggled.</p>

<p>Torvin cherished allowing his staff these small freedoms, or statements, or whatever they were. I continued writing action items on the whiteboard. For awhile there was nothing but the sound of Tony slurping coffee and the robotic whine of the Dune Buggy’s electric motors. Then Renaldo came in.</p>

<p>“Renaldo,” I said. “Glad you decided to join us. At least you can catch the closing remarks.”</p>

<p>He grinned at everyone, raised his Peregrino bottle in a toast. “Someone hasn’t added me to their Meeting Maker yet,” he said. Referring, of course, to me.</p>

<p>He was wearing his usual Czechoslovakian drunken train conductor pants, showing more dribble stains than usual, and had a loosened polka-dot tie draped around his neck. </p>

<p>“We don’t use Meeting Maker here,” I said. “We use Mallsoft Systems Labs TimeSchedule Wizard.”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed, even Renaldo, so I played it off like I’d made a joke. But even though Renaldo was laughing, a sour look crept under his goatee. I kept smiling at him, challenging that sour look, but he hunkered into a corner of the floor where I couldn’t even see him.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “For the last time, I think now we can get started. Now that the big boss is here.”</p>

<p>“Let it go,” Torvin said, to his laptop.</p>

<p>I grinned at him. “Torvin, if you’re done wooing your machine, we’ll get going.”</p>

<p>This statement actually was a joke, and it didn’t get so much as a scarcely cracked smirk. “Let it go,” I repeated, not realizing in the moment that I was repeating myself. I looked around the room at uncomfortable faces, and when Torvin looked up, it was with inscrutable blue eyes and raised eyebrows and commendably neutral mouth. A perfectly straight line from one corner to the other. Wow, was he good at this stuff. A born Neutral. I turned my embarrassed back to them all, and as I slid the point of my dry erase marker across the shiny white surface, I breathed deeply through my nose, getting all the fumes.</p>

<p>The action item I directed their attention to, right under TMS: ENHANCE HASHCRYPTING ENGINE, was VSE ALGORITHM. I drew a helpful arrow to it, right up to the V in VSE.</p>

<p>The TMS was the Tokenizing Media Spindle, and hashcrypting was our name for the patented process of producing Media Tokens, which allowed protected media to be played on SwarfTag-capable devices. The TMS was what I considered our core product, and the engine that did the actual encryption was vital, like a heart, to our success. VSE stood for Very Strong Encryption, which is exactly what it sounds like. The stronger the better, since if anyone ever found a way to reverse engineer it, our products would be worthless.</p>

<p>We had a VSE algorithm already. I had written it. Actually, it was a slightly modified version of a very well-known Mallsoft encryption system. The initial hashcrypting engine was good enough to demo Der Swarftagger, but Torvin wanted powerful encryption for the next release. If possible, he said, he wanted something professional enough to go to market with.</p>

<p>“I want the opposite of a brute force attack,” he said. “I want a brute force defense.”</p>

<p>He started getting excited about how powerful it had to be. Manny cut in: “It can’t be so strong that you can’t export it, Torv.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah,” Torvin said. “Of course. It’s gotta be approved for export.”</p>

<p>“Unless,” someone said, “We use something with a variable key length.”</p>

<p>“Like El Gamal,” said Renaldo’s voice, from the floor.</p>

<p>Manny brightened. Tony, looking down at Renaldo, wiggled his toes. Everyone tried to look thoughtful and serious. “It’s a good idea!” Manny said, twisting around in his seat. “We can use any size we want for domestic versions, and keep it at 128 for exports.”</p>

<p>“For some reason I hadn’t even considered El Gamal,” said some dummy from the left.</p>

<p>Torvin was following avidly. “Would that mean we could just use an existing algorithm and not have to worry about doing this from scratch?”</p>

<p>“El Gamal is pretty solid,” Renaldo said.</p>

<p>Manny was nodding as if some Mexican bull operator had taken control of his head. He started babbling about private key lengths and time to market and multiplying product cycles.</p>

<p>“I think we need something original,” I said. “Maybe we can call it ¡El Garitmo!, you know, with two exclamation points, like a name for a Mexican dance or something. What do you think of that name, Manny?”</p>

<p>He frowned. “This isn’t a nomenclature meeting, Chad.”</p>

<p>Before I could counter that with a point about the importance of not compartmentalizing product development at this early stage, Torvin spoke. “My concern,” he said, “is that if we use a known encryption system, it will be easier for people to crack our encryption.”</p>

<p>I allowed Tony to explain that this was not true. Tony was our analogy man, and he used one Torvin could relate to immediately: someone might be able to get a machine that makes car keys, but they still wouldn’t be able to make a key that would start his Pontius. To do that, they would need his key, which would obviate the need for the key-making machine. The thing that creates the key doesn’t have to be a secret, the key itself just needs to be complex enough that it has no substitute.</p>

<p>The problem with Tony’s toe-wriggling analogies is that sometimes they don’t stop coming. That one great one was all Torvin needed. I saw the look of total Torvin-hension. But Tony felt the need for another one, a tired old fingerprint analogy. We knew, he said (in the throes of analogy-rapture), we knew enough about fingerprints to fabricate them ourselves, but no matter how precise our ability to create them got, no one would ever be able to create Torvin’s fingerprint without already having it.</p>

<p>“Right, right,” Torvin said. “There can only ever be one like it. That’s what we want.”</p>

<p>I needed to step in.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the great analogies, Tony, but we have an actual product here, in an actual market, and as your analogies also demonstrate, there does exist a little thing called Points for Originality. The product itself has to be based on original technology that we own the patent to, or someone else will just copy it and steal our market.”</p>

<p>Torvin’s eyes got wide. He put his thumbnail between his front teeth and flared his nostrils, something he only did when he caught a whiff of failure. He said softly, “We can’t have that.”</p>

<p>Tony looked thoroughly disgusted with me, and Renaldo suddenly rose from his hiding place like some kind of Eastern European carjacker, and he faced me with something less than a Neutral Buddy expression, and said “Let’s not forget how important it is to actually get the thing on the market. If we try to reinvent the wheel, not only will we come up with a very flawed wheel, but we’ll waste valuable time doing it.”</p>

<p>Manny was nodding again, doing everything to show his approval short of yelling ¡Ole! The bull operator rides again, I thought. And Torvin: from his look, I gathered he was now getting the full-on fetor of his imagined spiral into the obscurity of the ane-holes of startup failures. Renaldo was cajoling him with pure fear.</p>

<p>The others in the room somehow saw wisdom in Renaldo’s inane pep talking. A born leader, they saw in Renaldo. I saw a posturing, pabulum-reciting clown. Why did everyone find it so impossible to hate him?</p>

<p>It was me and him now, in that conference room, mano-a-mano. I told him he needed to review his entrepreneurial history book, and he said well, maybe I should try calling my bank.</p>

<p>Everyone looked at him and blinked, including me. It was a comment that made no sense, and I told him that. It was obvious from the expectant way everyone looked at him that they thought the same.</p>

<p>“Just call your bank,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, smirking. “And why should I do that?”</p>

<p>“Cause I don’t think that reality check cleared.”</p>

<p>Oh, everyone—new hires included—found this terribly funny. Their individual laughs were so simultaneous and so abrupt that the whole room practically shook with it. And many of them continued laughing for some time. My face burned. Renaldo smiled in goat-faced approval, swung his torso around, swung it to swing his arm to swing that Peregrino bottle with a pirateer’s grip on its neck. I said something back to him which has since been drowned out in my mind by that chorus of laughter.</p>

<p>But I cannot say that kind of exchange was typical. Renaldo had an especially saucy manner on that day. After he made his little joke, he stood there enjoying the reaction, absorbing it, nodding squinty and goat-faced like a headbanger, with a smile that to me looked more like bared teeth. An animal, he was—the image haunts me—rock-starring with his Peregrino bottle, twisting his torso to survey his approving audience, approving of their approval, approving of himself basking in that approval. He might as well have had a foot planted on my chest. Spit in my eye. Taken a numero dos on my head.</p>

<p>Finally they quieted down enough for Torvin to say, “Take it easy, Chad.”</p>

<p>I must have been sputtering the whole time. Finally I could offer a rebuttal that everyone heard, as I pointed a pro wrestler finger at Rumpled Renaldo: “Who let this homeless man in here? Hah? Who let this guy in? He’s a common beggar, that’s all, a beggar for laughs! I mean, how did this sorry, sloppy, Slovakian train wreck get in here? Huh? I mean”—I waved a dismissal over my head—”take him out back, you know. Luigi says take him out back! Tonight he plays with dolphins. Take him out back and shoot him in the head!”</p>

<p>I made myself laugh with this one, but no one else seemed to like it.</p>

<p>“Just shoot him in the head,” I said, laughing again. It really was funny, and I’m sure it was the kind of thing they all laughed about later. “Out back!” I shouted. “Take him out back! Play with the dolphins tonight!”</p>

<p>“Chad,” Torvin said.</p>

<p>“He’s like a badly molested Slovakian street urchin, this guy!”</p>

<p>“Hey.”</p>

<p>“Check out that outfit! I mean—”</p>

<p>“Hey, Chad!”</p>

<p>“What, I mean, I’ve seen better pants on Iraqi orphans!”</p>

<p>“Just take it easy.”</p>

<p>“Hey,” I said. “Torvin, you just don’t know me. I’m taking it easy right now. This is me taking it easy.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say anything. I looked around the room. Everyone was silent. Renaldo was standing with his arms crossed. Tony’s toes didn’t move. Manny pretended to look at something on his laptop.</p>

<p>“Take five,” I said.</p>

<p>We took five. Regrouped, with what I must say were more even tempers.</p>

<p>The peace would not last though. I began to lay out the requirements of the new hashcrypting code, based on the functional specification of Der SwarfTagger, and it was not long before Renaldo interrupted. To his credit, he was polite about it. Neutral. He raised his hand, a little bit. It was an effort, much more than he’d made earlier, to be respectful. He said excuse me. Twice. And then he said, “Hey!” and I looked. “I don’t want you to freak out again or anything, but who do you see actually authoring this algorithm?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I’d open that up, see who has the appropriate experience. Any volunteers here?”</p>

<p>No one moved.</p>

<p>“Surely we have someone here familiar with encryption systems.”</p>

<p>They stared at me, as if waiting for me to figure something out.</p>

<p>“If there’s anyone,” Torvin said, “It’s you.”</p>

<p>I explained that while I had some experience writing such things, I didn’t know if it would be the best allocation of resources. Perhaps, I suggested, I could oversee someone from this team and provide whatever assistance they needed.</p>

<p>Torvin balked, and before he could say much, I said, “We should take this discussion offline.”</p>

<p>To this, he gave a miniature nod, biting his thumbnail as he did it.</p>

<p>I tried to sell him on outsourcing it. I said, “Not to rule out the possibility of me doing it, but another option would be we could outsource it. Find a contractor.”</p>

<p>“How long would that take?”</p>

<p>“Maybe two or three weeks to find someone, another three or four to have them get it working.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have that kind of time,” Torvin said.</p>

<p>Manny was shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Manny, you disagree with Torvin?” I asked, hoping for some backup.</p>

<p>“No, I agree, I don’t think we have that kind of time either.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, beginning to draw a more-wavery-than-wanted timeline across the full length of the whiteboard. It was a bumpy, or wiggly path, depending on which axis you were on. A jittery jagged course full of misdirection and equivocation, this timeline. Placing some unevenly spaced hashmarks on it, I said: “We <em>have</em> to have that kind of time.”</p>

<p>“Well we don’t,” Torvin said. “Can you just continue the work you did on the original hashcrypting algorithm?”</p>

<p>Some dummy, an interface guy, raised his fat hand and said, “Um, is there a chance we could return to the subject of using some already established algorithm? I mean, I tend to agree that time-to-market is really important, but &#8230; ”</p>

<p>I cut him off. “Well, if you’ll let me finish my timeline here, I can speak to that.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Then I graciously added, “Of course, this an open forum, so you should finish what you have to say.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Well, I was just saying we could pursue that off-the-shelf solution discussion again before we talk about hiring contractors.”</p>

<p>“We’re not hiring contractors,” Torvin interjected. “There’s no discussion on that.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, I mean,” the dummy said, “Even doing it in-house. It just seems better for now to—”</p>

<p>“We’re talking about quality here,” I said. “I don’t understand why everyone is so opposed to fine engineering, instead of another hastily-marketed pile of crap.”</p>

<p>There was an anger-dissipating silence, and then Torvin: “I agree with Ryan. And Renaldo. We can sit here for years perfecting something, Chad, but, with all due respect to your work at Motomoto, we don’t have the luxury of a big company’s R and D department. We’ve got to get it out there quickly.”</p>

<p>I turned to the whiteboard and continued placing bold, slanted, hashmarks across my timeline.</p>

<p>And I spent the next half hour walking them through half of that timeline, hash by hash. But it didn’t help.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I volunteered to write the hashcrypting algorithm myself. I admit, I am no algorithm expert. Perhaps I just couldn’t stand the idea that Renaldo’s suggestion of an off-the-shelf solution would hold up in that meeting. It came down to a face off, right there in front of that Renaldo-loving audience, with Renaldo saying, “The fact is, we don’t have time for contractors, and we don’t have anyone in house who can do it.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” I said, raising an objecting index finger, “Torvin just said if we have anyone, it’s me.”</p>

<p>Renaldo looked at Torvin. Torvin closed his eyes. Renaldo didn’t want to challenge Torvin’s statements, but he had no qualms about challenging mine. He sat back down, and for some reason, this deference, which was obviously for Torvin and not me, made me blurt: “I’ll write the frickin thing myself, then. Topic closed.”</p>

<p>Torvin was stammering something, but I had turned my back to them again, erasing the timeline I’d started and beginning a somewhat more ambitious diagram, more elaborate and expansive than the first.</p>

<p>“—just like to ask that we continue to explore this topic a bit longer—just a bit, uh, Chad, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Now I turned to face Torvin. “The topic is closed as far as this meeting is concerned, Torvin. You and I can take it offline if you’d like, but I think right now the prudent thing is to move on to the TMS authoring interface.”</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded by my authority, I think. We did take that topic offline, later that day, and in another conference room, just the two of us, we pursued it. Nothing was resolved immediately. I disagreed with Torvin about the feasibility of hiring a contractor, and we had a few meetings-of-the-minds on that topic, and Torvin, to my dismay, seemed to have even less confidence than I did in my ability to generate a reliable, powerful algorithm. Fortunately, Doubting Thomases and Skeptical Torvins only tend to strengthen my resolve. And that Rambunctious Renaldo had only summoned a ferocious courage from me.</p>

<p>So I saw it as a challenge. One to which I would rise. I could see the cover of Dealmakers 2.0 already: Torvin and myself in a stairstepped promo shot, preferably with me on the top step, and not too blocked by Torvin. At my shoulder, the bright white Helvetica letters spelling out: Chad Tidwell, <em>CTO, New Digital Controls</em>. That was the future.</p>

<p>Some weeks passed. I should have known whose side Torvin was on when he went to the board with the algorithm I developed. I don’t know exactly who reviewed the code, but Torvin came back to me and said, without mincing words, that it was weak. Apparently, Dirk on the board knew some tough-guy crypto expert in Silly Con Valley, and tough-guy had reviewed my code thoroughly (though I don’t know just how thoroughly, I only had Torvin’s word) and come to the conclusion that, if used in Der SwarfTagger, it could be easily compromised. I asked how this guy could be so sure, whether he had actually cracked it or whether his conclusion was entirely theoretical, and Torvin said it didn’t matter, that this guy was a very trusted resource; his opinion mattered enough to Dirk to make this a no-go. I was in a desperate situation. We just could not afford for Renaldo to be right. I got on the interweb the very day I had that conversation with Torvin and went to contractorcentral-dot-com and typed our requirements into an official request. By the end of the day, I had thirty emails and attached resumes.</p>

<p>I had hoped that necessity and the scarcity of responses would make the applicant review process quick and easy, but as I scanned the qualifications of each applicant, the lists of arcane languages, the mysteriously-named departments of research universities, the unparseable dissertation and article titles that read like genome strings of alien entities, I could see right away there was no time to make an informed decision.</p>

<p>I needed a referral, from someone I trusted, and it couldn’t be anyone in my office.</p>

<p>It ended up being Jenna’s cousin, but that didn’t turn out well either.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I appreciate having a man-to-man conversation, even if it is with Renaldo. Even if it is a sort of side conversation to the main conversation of life, which is marriage.</p>

<p>Something Renaldo may never know.</p>

<p>There was a period of time, when we were getting settled in Candlewood Green, that we stopped seeing Donald and Myrianna together anymore. Holy cow was I grateful for that break. They were dealing with the divorce, dividing possessions, etcetera. Donald ended up in an apartment in Evanston. Then he supposedly moved to Toronto, which pretty much figures for a guy like him. Nowadays without him around, Myrianna visits too often, and it leaves no opportunity for a side conversation of any kind. I am a spectator.</p>

<p>I miss Donald’s presence. Even if all he ever seemed able to talk about was Illinois Prairie birdlife. </p>

<p>The last time I saw him was at Plucky Ducky’s. It was sheer coincidence. We glanced at each other, then away, then looked back in a sudden moment of mutual recognition. I immediately hailed Ducky for the tab and started to excuse myself, but Donald stopped me by gripping my forearm. He said he wanted to apologize for something. I said I was happy to graciously accept any apology for anything. But instead of apologizing for anything, he started to tell me about the divorce. At some point during that I started to leave again, but he forcibly sat me down by gripping my shoulder and pushing me back onto the stool. He was rambling, clearly drunk but no more so than I’d ever seen him before, and in a pontificatory frame of mind. I decided to play along for a bit, with this. I’m a philosophical guy, always up for a little dialectic. Besides, I had decided, at that point, that I wanted to ask him something. We had never discussed this Mona Joules-LeFarb before. And maybe he knew something useful.</p>

<p>“You see,” he was saying. “Women are far better than men are at backstabbing. The advantage women have is that they work all their lives to hide their hatred. And when the time comes: boom, you don’t know what hit you.”</p>

<p>“That&#8217;s just a little melodramatic, don&#8217;t you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it? Is it?” He began to sashay his head like kelp in the wake of a powerboat. “Is it just a little teensy-weensy bit melodramatic? Is it then? Really? Well, that’s cause it&#8217;s true! A woman could hate you and keep you in the dark about it as long as she needs to.”</p>

<p>He paused for a beat to suckle his RonPico and cola, and I saw it as my opportunity to ask him about Miss Wacky Pants, the Francophone academic our wives (or my wife and his ex-) had been long obsessed with. So I asked. Of course, he made me wait for the answer, in his dramatic style. He first drained his bev down to ice with a slurp and set it on the bar. Then he waved his other hand at Ducky, raising the index finger up to signal either quantity finished, quantity desired, or number of people in the room with important needs to be fulfilled quickly. Ducky looked, and Donald arced the pointer down to indicate his unsubmerged pile of ice. Finally, he nodded deeply, almost bowing to his glass. He said, in an unrushed voice, to the glass: “You’re talking about Mona BubbleButt.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” I said, annoyed at his antics. ”Whatever her name is.”</p>

<p>“I call her BubbleButt cause she’s got a big old ass. A big juicy double-bubble ass, and from what I know about academic philosophy babes, probably likes anal too. Plus, she’s got a hot face. I’m tellin you, you need to typeglob the celebrity fakes of her. Classic strokin material.”</p>

<p>“Yeah &#8230; no. I can’t erase her dirty feet from my mind.”</p>

<p>“Whatever. She’ll suck your toes too.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she like, pro-choice, or something? I still can’t figure out how that jibes with Jenna’s &#8230; sensibility.”</p>

<p>Donald snorted. For a second he looked completely despondent. Then his eyes got wide as he saw a new drink coming his way. It was delivered on a fresh Plucky Ducky’s coaster and he took a first sip worthy of a sigh.</p>

<p>“Pro-choice, right. More like anti-life,” he said. “According to what I’ve read and heard Myrianna parroting, she’s <em>anti-child</em>. And if you can’t imagine anyone in the humanities taking that position, and I know you can’t, put this in your wand and blow: she’s <em>anti-human</em>. She actually calls herself an anti-humanist. Makes a point not to rule out alien life forms. Says there’s definitely something better than us out there, and we should think more like it. Make pod babies and such from alien seed.”</p>

<p>“Jenna must just pretend to be into this chick. Or Myrianna’s got her brainwashed.”</p>

<p>Donald slurped down half the liquid in his glass. At some point in his next pontification, which was about the special talents that women have for brainwashing, and various precedents in cults and suchlike where women were used as the primary indoctrinators, and how those special talents were always coupled with linguistic sexual techniques, by way of telling me that Myrianna had taken classes in brainwashing. I didn’t believe him for a second, but I had plenty of questions. </p>

<p>“Yeah, Myrianna knew how to do that. Lamashtu institute. Look it up. She ripped every hobby I had to shreds whenever she could. Lemme tell you about the box of books in the garage.”</p>

<p>At that point, I’d gotten enough information, and I started once again to excuse myself. But he was insisting I keep listening, that he had this apology. And then he signaled to Ducky and bought me a drink, and since he was buying, I ordered a MacSkirlin 12, and then, as someone said, somewhere, he owned me.</p>

<p>“Box of books,” he said. “I spent a good ten years collecting bird books, textbooks, anything. Whenever I found a new one, I&#8217;d keep it. Myrianna said they were moldy, filthy things. She thought they had bugs in them. How ridiculous is that? She said bugs would crawl out of them! I assure you there were no bugs in those books. Except illustrations. Robins with wriggly worms. She hated them. She made me keep them in a box in the garage. She didn&#8217;t want anyone else to see them. Fine, I said. So I did. When I wanted to look at one, I&#8217;d haul it out of the garage. So one day I came home, and the whole box is gone. I said what did you do with it Myrianna and she said I took it to goodwill and I said those weren&#8217;t the books that were supposed to go to goodwill, Myrianna, the other box had books for goodwill, but not that one, and she said oh I&#8217;m so sorry I thought you meant both boxes. I said tell me what goodwill you took them to Myrianna, I need to retrieve them. She told me it was the goodwill we always go to, in Schaumburg. I went there, immediately. They said they had some boxes of books I could look through, but they didn&#8217;t know if they had the boxes I was looking for. So I looked through all the books in all the boxes in the back of the goodwill, and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, none of mine were there. Do you know what I think she did?”</p>

<p>“What?&quot; I asked, playing along.”</p>

<p>“I think she just threw them all away. Because she had an excuse to, and because she knew she couldn&#8217;t be fully blamed. She had waited a long long time for that opportunity, Chad. A long long long long time. And she acted like oh yes of course I dropped them off there I can&#8217;t believe they didn&#8217;t have them. What did they do, throw them away? And then, would you believe the fucking nerve. Then—she tried to fuck me. She thought if she fucked me, I would forget about it! But I wasn&#8217;t going to make it that easy. See, there was another reason I wanted to keep those books. There was one book in that box that I really truly cared about having back, and it was German ornithology textbook from 1897, called Gefährdete Vogel Optikspiel with absolutely beautiful illustrations in it. It was a rare book, worth a lot of money actually, but that&#8217;s not why I wanted it back. I wanted it back because, folded up inside it, between two of the center pages, were three drawings, on tracing paper, of a new kind of overlay display I&#8217;d come up with. I had just started getting into optics, and I was having new ideas all the time, but this was one that related specifically to an idea I&#8217;d gotten from the pages of that book, from a diagram of a device that at the time was completely fantastic which would project a magnified image onto a photographic plate with information about that specimen. The idea was that you should be able to scribble notes, or at least substitute overlays of scientific names on the picture you were going to take, and my idea was &#8230; Well, never mind. The whole point here is that she got rid of those diagrams and that&#8217;s what made me so very very upset about it, not the books. Not the books. Somewhere out there are other copies of those books. But the ideas &#8230; there is no way to predict what a woman&#8217;s hatred is going to take away.”</p>

<p>At that moment, staring at him, it struck me that Donald was an ugly man, uglier than I’d thought before. I mean that literally. His nose at that proximity was gigantic and there were hairs peeking out of the nostrils. His eyes had purple circles beneath them, giving them a sunken look. I looked away, at a sign behind the bar that said, A WOMAN DROVE ME TO DRINK AND I DIDN&#8217;T HAVE THE DECENCY TO THANK HER. But I was stuck there with him for awhile. And the more the ice swirled in the MacSkirlin and it skirled around inside me, the more curious I was.</p>

<p>So I found out more. Myrianna got the house and the car. She threw out about half his stuff; he took her to small claims court; she filed a restraining order. At this last detail, he grinned, as if he relished it. She made up all this stuff about threats he made, didn’t make. He left some messages, sure, he said, but they weren’t threats. And he came over a couple times, but only as a visitor. And the second time he visited himself upon her, she called the police, filed a report, threatened the restraining order but didn’t do it. And then one day, he was tearing up the apartment looking for something, as usual, that she probably had in the house and threw away or burned—a field guide, maybe, three of those were missing, or the spare Kari Scheiss lens he never could find, or the keys to a safe deposit box with his mother’s jewelry in it that Myrianna got, unbelievably, with the help of her lawyer—he was looking for something, doesn’t even matter what it was, and came across this rusty old Hide-a-Key thing, this little metal box with a sliding lid, ancient, came from his mother’s house, and he opened it and what was inside but a key, with a keytag that said: Back door. It was Myrianna’s handwriting. He kept it. Then he said he’d gotten in the habit of visiting the place while she was out, that he’d wait in the back yard at night until he saw that she was gone, and then he’d let himself in by the patio door. Sit in his old chair, pee on her toothbrush, snoop around on her computer.</p>

<p>And then came his apology. He apologized if he’d been sneaking around where he shouldn’t be, and I said, well why would you apologize to me for that? And he said well, because he’d seen me in there, had seen me from his vantage in the landscaping, waltzing around in the living room, not literally waltzing, of course, but in an embarrassing condition, apparently talking to myself and stepping around in small circles. More on that later: needless to say, at that point in our chance encounter, he had my full attention.</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” he said, cutting me off before I could even stop being dumbfounded. “You want to explain. I get it. But just let me tell you something else you’ll find interesting. And this is just some more information about Myrianna that you might not have known.”</p>

<p>He said one time he and Myrianna had wanted to spice up their bedroom a bit, so he’d registered on e-hookups-dot-net, a genteel swingers club online. He put in an ad seeking an under&#8211;25 PCB, Petite Caucasian Brunette, to join them in spirited three-way lovemaking sessions. He paid the hundred forty dollar yearly registration fee to become a platinum member, which allowed both him and Myrianna to access other platinum members’ profiles and get their contact information and view pictures, etc. He put up a profile: two caucasian nonsmokers, married, seeking single caucasian nonsmoking female, under&#8211;25, very petite, for “casual play.” He uploaded a picture of himself, a rough outdoorsy picture of him in a kerosene hat and down vest with a flannel on underneath and his powerful binocs hanging around his neck, and he also uploaded one of Myrianna’s choice, a bikini photo of her lying face down on the sand, rubbing lotion on her ass, taken at the Indiana Dunes the previous summer.</p>

<p>Dozens of women responded. They sent pictures and Donald was surprised at how stunningly beautiful they all were. Several of them sent birthday suit pictures, and one sent something positively gynecological. He admitted he should have realized that they were responding essentially to Myrianna’s picture and not his. He could have seen it, he said, if he’d cared to notice that all of the emails seemed to take a tone of address aimed more at her. The most frequent question any of them had, by far, was whether they would be required to be penetrated with a real male organ. Those who asked were always the ones who didn’t want it to happen. And of course, he and Myrianna’s original idea had been to share all the sexual resources equally, meaning everything but anal. They specified in the post that anal was off-limits, for <em>play</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve never known anyone as crass as Donald. I made it a point to make a gross-out face every time he said the word “play.” But he continued unfazed. The next thing he knew Myrianna had found someone, and once he saw the profile, he got very excited. She was, he told me, an attractive version of the teen pop star Babyfingers.</p>

<p>“You know,” he said, “The bleach-hole blonde type. The kind of chick who won’t be attractive enough in two years to be a sex symbol anymore. Legal Lolita, no one wants to admit all her glamour comes from the idea her parents don’t know about her bleached asshole yet.”</p>

<p>“You’ve lost me,” I said, intrigued, and knowing exactly what he meant.</p>

<p>Anyway, he said, the girl showed up on a Saturday night, and they all had a few drinks. At some point, Myrianna stood up, walked across the very room where Donald claimed to have seen me from a vantage in the yard, to where Babyfingers sat on the couch. She planted a knee on either side of her and kissed her full on the mouth. Then they all went to the bedroom. At first, it went pretty much how Donald had imagined, clothes coming off, mouths on various body parts. But Babyfingers kept Myrianna occupied most of the time.</p>

<p>“I was obliged to lick and suckle them both from the periphery like some kind of left-out puppy.”</p>

<p>At some point in the mix, Babyfingers’ rear was in the air, bleached, not to mention well-waxed, and presenting an invitingly swollen pudenda, so Donald knee-walked up to it and put himself inside the supposedly okay-to-play area. It got him the dirtiest look from Babyfingers, who stopped licking long enough to look over her shoulder, as if he’d vomited on her back, and say, “You are wearing protection, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>He was indeed wearing protection—I asked him the same question at that point in the tale, as it’s always an important factor for me. Then he began to muse in a pedantic manner about how rather exciting it all was, something about sexual dynamism and the spirit of what some philosopher called pleasure-angst, and I tuned out for a bit, slowly draining my MacSkirlin and marveling at its complexity and character.</p>

<p>What tuned me back in was him saying that later on, as Babyfingers lay on top of Myrianna, belly to belly, neck-sucking, he was asked squarely, by his wife, if he would mind leaving them alone for awhile. He was flabbergasted. Then Myrianna actually began to beg him. Please, she begged. Could she and Babyfingers be alone? He found himself listening to her, then standing up, as if he was just going to comply without question. This is the effect Myrianna has on men, he said pointedly.</p>

<p>But he didn’t leave. An argument broke out. Babyfingers seemed to be waiting for a sign from Myrianna. Donald insisted this was not a part of their agreement. Myrianna countered that they had both agreed not to be jealous, no matter what. That threw him for a loop. He couldn’t respond to it. He stormed out and went right to the kitchen, to fix himself a nice stiff drink.</p>

<p>“And as I looked back over my shoulder, I saw Babyfingers in the bedroom doorway. Yeah. My bedroom! And she just turned out the light and closed the door.”</p>

<p>He shifted uneasily as he told that part, uncrossing his leg and leaning suddenly forward, his face breaking out in red blotches, his eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>Then he launched into the legal aftermath, even though I insisted I didn’t want to hear any more. Things got worse all around, with Babyfingers somehow still involved, and Myrianna filed for divorce.</p>

<p>He stood up from his stool then, a bit unsteadily, and acted out the whole divorce court scenario, leaning forward, with a hand on his hip, for the attorney’s lines, and leaning back, crossing his arms, for the part of Babyfingers. He also depicted Babyfingers with a kind of prissy, lip-puckered look of vengeance on her face. His take was that she perjured herself in order to assist Myrianna’s case for divorce and deliberately increase the financial and personal damages, portraying him as a vindictive, lesbian-hating mysogynist. Actually, all of that might be true.</p>

<p>The case against him portrayed Donald, possibly correctly, as a lascivious drunk who signed up for e-hookups-dot-net without Myrianna’s consent, brought women into the house and forced her to have sex with them. It didn’t help his case later that the account had been entirely registered and paid for in his name, on his credit card, and he had written the profile and uploaded the pictures. The pictures made quite an impression in court. The judge made a point to interrupt proceedings to ask what type of cream or salve she was applying in the photo. “Is that just suntain lotion?” No one knew what the point of asking was, but no one wanted to ask the judge why.</p>

<p>When it came to chat logs, it was discovered that Myrianna had not actually corresponded with any of the women as he thought she had. It also came out in court that Babyfingers didn’t even have an e-hookups-dot-net account at the time of the soiree. She apparently created the account sometime afterwards, a “fact” that was overlooked. She claimed Donald had contacted her through e-hookups and asked her to have sex with him while Myrianna watched.</p>

<p>Myrianna’s attorney, who Donald referred to as Nick the Prick, asked how comfortable she, Babyfingers, was with having intercourse with Donald, and she replied, “Very uncomfortable,” and just to get a dig in, added, “It didn’t last long.” The attorney asked what else she could say about how she felt during the experience, and she replied, “The most humiliating thing for me was when he got done and practically ordered me to perform a sexual act on his wife. I was disgusted. I don’t sleep with women, and I felt degraded by the way he commanded me.”</p>

<p>The well-rehearsed courtroom drama he recited was beginning to bore me, so I asked him to cut to the chase. At that point, I was sure he had somehow followed me to Plucky Ducky’s, and now I was ready to leave, but only after he got to the point. With some coaxing on my part, it came out that, according to his twisted logic, I “owed” him something in the future, some unspecified, to-be-determined “favor.” And why? I asked him, would I owe him anything?</p>

<p>“Well, so I don’t show anyone the pictures I took,” he said, giving me a most smug indeed grin.</p>

<p>I laughed: Oh, I laughed. Then I looked around nervously. An Indian man down the bar appeared to be bending forward to lap directly from his overfull beer glass.</p>

<p>“Let’s keep things discreet,” I said.</p>

<p>He tittered. “Say hi to Jenna for me, will you, Chad?” He tittered again.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to be threatened.”</p>

<p>“Chad,” he said. “No one’s threatening you. These are facts. You were nude. You were nude in my wife’s house. There are photos.”</p>

<p>I nodded, backing away from the bar. Then I did a real zinger of a lie. “Nice seeing you Donald.”</p>

<p>But just before I turned away, I noticed what he’d placed next to my empty glass.</p>

<p>It was a glossy print of a yellow diamond of light with me at the center. Nude. </p>

<p>He had me there. The incriminating picture had been taken just days before.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>All of this is ancient history now, of course. And like ancient history, it’s of no real consequence. It was over a year ago! A different world. Back then, Jenna and I still lived our the old house in Thornberry Hills. A different way of life entirely. We’ve all moved on at this juncture, sort of. Even if some of us have moved on more than others, we’ve all moved, in some direction.</p>

<p>It started when Myrianna asked to borrow a necklace from Jenna. It was this heirloom frou-frou piece from some old Polish great-crone or other. It had once reportedly been in a display case in some hallowed Krakow university or something, and why she trusted me with it that night I have no idea. It was supposed to be movie night, and we had a DVD of The Night Shaman’s latest masterpiece of screen writing. A tale of woe and intrigue. Set in a beach town, with Jerry Tomsky as a jealous clairvoyant with the power to see a person’s whole life in one moment. And nobody believes him, of course. And Gary Wandinski as the wandering poet, who disguises himself as a local in order to get dirt on his ex-wife, played by Teá Britworth. They all three get mixed up in an offshore Ponzi scheme cover-up and end up chasing each other through a carnivalesque third-world bazaar while the clock ticks down. And of course, at the end, Tomsky turns out to be the real deal, the poet dies, and the beach town turns out to be on an engineered island, when you thought all along it was on the mainland and they’re all trapped there in the end!</p>

<p>It was a great movie, and I didn’t so much care about seeing it again, but at that moment, I was ready to start. Especially as I thought it might lead into something else between us. We had just settled into the couch, and I had placed my hand on that special part of her hip, rubbing hopefully there. I gazed into her ear and watched her eyes as they watched the paused screen, which displayed the words: COPYRIGHT THEFT IS NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME. UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THIS MEDIA IS PROHIBITED. My hand was quickly removed.</p>

<p>After a bit, she said: “I hope it’s okay I volunteered you.”</p>

<p>I supposed maybe I hadn’t been listening, not completely, to every word she’d been saying in the last half hour. I had to ask: “Volunteered me for what?”</p>

<p>“She wants to borrow that diamond-lace necklace I have.”</p>

<p>She meaning Myrianna, I knew that much.</p>

<p>“She wants to borrow something, like, right now?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I told her I’d have you run it over. I have to give Ethan a bath and get him in bed before we can really do this movie thing. It would be really nice of you.”</p>

<p>“Right this minute?”</p>

<p>“She’s going out on a date tonight, new guy, and it’s a formal affair, and she doesn’t have anything that works with her new dress.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just find it hard to believe she expects us to drop everything—”</p>

<p>“Please, Chad.”</p>

<p>So I had to do it. As our favorite celebrity chef, Chef Von Rapier, would say when the risotto is burnt, <em>dü boofed it all!</em>. This particular movie night appeared to be doomed. She could get very demanding, and it was better, most of the time, not to protest too much. I agreed, but only after an exchange of words in which I stomped in a circle on the carpet and threw a toss pillow at Ethan’s portable crib. Then I walked out into the summer night air and, incensed, strolled down the buckling, tarwebbed lane toward Myrianna’s house.</p>

<p>In that old neighborhood, or “hood” as Myrianna called it, the streets were narrow, their cracks sealed with tar like so many crisscrossed strips of electrician’s tape. The houses in that neighborhood are like cardboard boxes lining a dark alley. Squat, dumpy little things, with small yards and big trees. I am grateful I no longer own one of those money pits. They are the real estate equivalent of legacy computer systems, and our old place was always falling behind code. Each year I would rectify certain problems and the next year it would fall behind again. For fifty years, families had been putting on additions, adding partitions, making doors out of windows and bathrooms out of closets or closets out of walls. Strange holes in the back of cabinets, bumpy drywall jobs, poor wiring. New carpet glued onto a hardwood floor. Doorways so crooked it was impossible to hang a new door in them.</p>

<p>I remember the crows that would gather. The aphids and worms that would kamikaze me and the squirrels, messy chewers that would spew acorn bits and send them raining through the canopies on my head. The robins aiming their poo at the windows of the minivan whenever we left it in the drive. In the gutters, dead leaves would disintegrate into a black muck that left behind a purple stain and occasionally a dead mouse would turn up there, bucktoothed and stiff. Once, a slimy sluglike thing, seven-point-two inches long, not counting bright red antennae, somehow found its way into the area under the kitchen sink, where an unnoticed leak had also attracted a colony of roly-polies to the rotting particle board. Every August, I was at war with ants, with their crisscrossing march formations on the kitchen counter, transporting crumbs from invisible crack to invisible crack. Everything had to be kept in tupperware.</p>

<p>I admit that the foliage looks nice on those older properties, and in close quarters those trees make great privacy screens, but all that lawn-smothering shade and branch detritus: can you say bare patches? And the extra oxygen is no trade off for all the prenatal hazards of an older house. Nice to have trees out there, but definitely not worth having a child with an avulsed belly or a withered arm. In the end, a bright green lawn looks just as nice as a canopy of leaves. I am immensely grateful that Jenna and I have moved on to bigger and better things. To a safer, lower maintenance, larger, cleaner, newer home. Our new lawn has a Goldrain-Nitro irrigation system. Lush, radiant green, like a carpet, spring through fall. And hardly any trees.</p>

<p>Myrianna’s house was in the middle of the block. It was ranch-style, and like the dressing of the same name, was nothing special. Typical, ubiquitous style. The bedroom was all the way at one end, and the kitchen at the other. Most of the center area was this living room/entryway space. There was a big picture window looking out on the front lawn and a set of sliding doors and vertical blinds that led to the back patio. Just to one side of that, an addition with a sun room jutted into the backyard. The addition always had its windows blocked off with screens and long curtains, but they still called it a sun room.</p>

<p>That night, I was a little taken aback when she appeared at her front door in a stunning evening gown, made up like a Parisian nightclub hooker. She carried the scent of what could have been some illegal Austrian aphrodisiac of Hapsburg vintage: apples, cloves and Gewurztraminer simmering in a red-hot iron kettle, perhaps. And mingled with that, maybe, probably, vodka. I could smell it on her.</p>

<p>I immediately had the kind of queasy discomfort I’d felt all summer, when she would join us in the park for concerts, barely wearing short shorts and a halter top, reclining languorously on a blanket. With her contacts in and her hair gelled into orangeish spikes, and her smooth abdomen and the hydraulic slinkings of her neck, she could be distracting to say the least. Not that she was anything like the diva-sexpot she imagined herself to be, but perhaps since the divorce she had toned down the frump factor once and for all. </p>

<p>She let me in and immediately sashayed off down the hall.</p>

<p>I glanced around the room. The desk had piles of mail, opened and unopened bills, various other papers and magazines cluttered on it. There were sticky notes on the computer screen. The place wasn’t filthy, but it was certainly cluttered. It made me uncomfortable. Jenna and I prefer a place with clear, uncluttered surfaces. Our dining room table and kitchen counters never accumulate mail. Bills are opened immediately and placed in a multi-slotted billminder we keep on the office wall. Magazines always go in the rack as soon as they’re received, and if we don’t read them within the month, they get tossed. We don’t own many books, and the few that we do own are out of sight (top shelf of the hall closet). We never leave things on the floor, like the scattered shoes I saw lying around. We would never just toss two long coats and a scarf over the arm of the couch either.</p>

<p>I peeked in the kitchen and saw that Donald’s poster on the fridge was gone from the refrigerator door. He was fond of telling me how interesting that poster was. Across the top it said PEREGRINATIONS. Below that intriguing line were photos of birds, falcons, perched on the arms of big-gloved men with pink faces, always on a sidewalk in some European capital. Donald took a lot of pleasure in naming the cities for me. And whenever he felt compelled to tell me (for the umpteenth time) that these birds were peregrine falcons, I asked if they were making doodie on the big gloves. This ruffled him everytime.</p>

<p>Now it had been replaced with another, equally obnoxious poster. This one was a woman sitting Indian-style on a white void, looking through one of those magnifying glass thingies used by jewelers, at a spot on what would be the ground or the floor if there were anything there other than a white void. At the bottom it said:</p>

<p>JEANS, NOT GENES!</p>

<p>The woman, grinning like a retard, had Myrianna’s exact haircut, and a profile that revealed her nose to be more snout than nose. I can’t get her stupid head out of my mind, and her long, slightly upturned nose, like it&#8217;s sniffing my business. She was wearing a sleeveless blouse and loose pants of a color I can only describe as Tomato Soup and her earrings were made of feathers. But what I really can’t forget was the bare sole of one foot, the toes splayed as if she was having so much fun being weird she couldn’t keep them in line. And they were disgustingly dirty. There were actually grains of dirt sticking to them, clinging to the whorls of the big toe.</p>

<p>The white void she seemed to be looking at actually held a cluster of dots, even smaller than the grains of dirt on her foot. I had to peer within inches of the glossy surface to see that some of the dots were not dots at all, but upside down V’s.</p>

<p>A repugnant poster, worse than Peregrinations to be sure. The woman pictured is none other than You-Know-Who.</p>

<p>Now, Myrianna is every part the divorceé with no perceivable limits on her extravagance or libido. She is also a terrible influence on Jenna. For example, they went to some conference downstate, at the University. Some kind of academic circus act involving, yes, You-Know-Who. For weeks in advance of the thing, I carried around a newspaper clipping in the front pocket of my Dickers, and I still have it as evidence. It was a small scrap that Jenna made the mistake of leaving on my desk, at home:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Noted Academic to Debate Policy Expert at Duff Hall</strong></p>

<p>Media theorist Yanni Lupenstein will debate noted French academic Mona Joules-LeFarb at Duff Hall as part of the Arnold Fokker lecture series. The topic of the debate, moderated by LeFarb herself, will be “Ionic Dispersion and Bionic Governance: A Balanced Solution for the Middle East.” LeFarb, who in the past has referred to terrorism as “an unsuppressable form of sassy group-expression” has garnered controversy with her newest publication, “Reinventing the Swarm,” which posits that “war is the new famine &#8230; but fashion is the problem.” Her opening remarks will address the equally controversial stance of Lupenstein, who has offered to fund a “new, new, new Jerusalem” and hypothesizes the creation of a so called “Zionic manifold,” a winding and autonomous territory only ten miles wide that would connect Baghdad with Palestine and the rest of Israel through the assistance of the US Military. Both pundits will be joined by a panel of experts on the War on Terrorism including the local politician and former candidate hopeful for the office of U.S. Secretary of Defense, Keith Enner Graf. Graf has recently been appointed director general of the ROTC Athlete Enlistment. Rantoul native Graf said the whole event sounds like a “real cluster of fun,” and looks forward to it.</p>

<p>That was not the only evidence. Very recently, during some of the routine home office system maintenance that I do on the days that I telecommute, I found a folder on Jenna’s desktop computer called <em>hip mommy ideas.</em> In it was a link to a New Democratic Radio interview called “The Radical Brilliance of Mona Joules-LeFarb.” At first, I didn’t click on the link. But then I found something else. A document from HealthHead-dot-net called “L’amazing Stories — Pain-free Naturally Induced Miscarriages.”</p>

<p>At that juncture, I felt, as an expectant father, I had reasonable cause. I did a few hard drive searches. One for a drug called L’amaze Me Plus. One for the word “herbs.” Turned up a link to a website selling Sassafras oil and Peony Smoothies. I came up with a real zinger: “Absinthe: Back Alley in a Bottle.”</p>

<p>I went to TellMePower-dot-com. I did an advanced typeglob search on the name Mona Joules-LeFarb, with extended summaries for all the results, 500 results per page. And I found out plenty. Too much to read through, in fact. A lot of things a father-to-be does not want to know.</p>

<p>I did try to escape, that night I brought the necklace. I called to Myrianna, who had disappeared into the far reach of the house, that I could just leave it for her.</p>

<p>“No, just wait there a second,” she called back.</p>

<p>The family photos on the mantel had been removed, leaving only one photo of Myrianna’s parents, a posturally erect duo with severe expressions and gray hair. There appeared to be fewer books overall. The walls, once white, were now painted turquoise, and there was a new floor lamp and a few plants. The place was less cluttered in general, the coffeetable in front of the couch strewn with magazines but none of them about birds or photography or paper arts. I peeked into the addition where Donald’s desk was and saw that it had been entirely transformed into a sewing room. The windows, formerly obscured with long black curtains, had been uncovered. In the center stood male and female showroom dummies, clothed in partially-completed garments. The male dummy wore some kind of studded leather harness and the female was clothed in only an inside-out skirt and knit poncho-thingy. On the hardwood floor was a tangle of lacy thongs which I stared at for some time with that strange feeling still in my gut.</p>

<p>I tried telling Myrianna again I could just leave the necklace but again she shouted for me to just hold on a sec.</p>

<p>From my end of the hall, I could spy her backside, and I did, in what there was of that negligible dress. The straps were there, but from my end of the hall the vision was of complete waist-up nudity, the waist-down obscured by the taper of that dress, sleek and scaly on her hips. I took a few steps into the passage. She was waving one hand, blowing on the other, waving it, blowing on the other. Her neck seemed to go all the way down her back. She saw me, seeing her, in the mirror, then I saw myself, like some housebreaker, necklace dangling from between my fingers, frozen in my tracks. I held it up, my eyes black twinkling beads in that mirror.</p>

<p>She called, “My fucking nails aren’t dry yet, could you do me big favor and help me get it on?”</p>

<p>“Date with Alfa?” I called.</p>

<p>“Alfa’s history,” she called back. “Tonight is just this singles mixer thing that the Irish Cultural Center is putting on. Should be lots of strapping young lads there.”</p>

<p>I always tried to be tolerant of Myrianna. Just a month or so before, I had tolerated her uploading what she called the dealio with the latest boyfriend, as she and Jenna sat caddy-corner to each other at the kitchen table.</p>

<p>At the time I was at the kitchen island, fixing the cordless phone. I had the IC board bared, Philips head against the centerpost screw, trying to free it so I could get a look at the wires on the other side, see if anything needed soldering. She gushed that he’s Italian, this boy, and he drives a Corvette and works at the Merc, and he’s twenty-five (to which Jenna remarked, a little too enthusiastically, “Oh, A Young One!”). He’s lived in America seven years, brushes his teeth three times a day, works out constantly, and has a cock—(and, as if she thought I was really listening, Myrianna interrupted herself to say, “Sorry, Chad,” as if I couldn’t handle a word like that)—a cock that will not stop! (Jenna, I’m glad to say, blushed.) &#8230; And this boy buys her gifts and flowers and talks about how much he loves his mother and he collects stuffed penguins and wants someday to own a racehorse and a penthouse in Gold Coast. At that, I concluded he was apparently one of the biggest European buttholes that ever came to Schaumburg. Both that and my previous outburst (“Stuffed Penguins? Are you kidding?”) went unnoticed and she continued: He took her to a restaurant and taught her how to dance a tango. He took her ice-skating and bought her perfume and also they walked around Lincoln Park trying martinis and that was the first night she decided to sleep with him, because, whatever, you know, why not try out the merchandise before you even consider buying it? And after three martinis, who gave a shit? So they went back to his flat in Lincoln Park, a gorgeous top floor of a three-flat brownstone that he was hoping to buy if it ever went on the market, and he told her that his mother used to rub his feet, and so he showed Myrianna how that was done, meaning he did it to her, and it was the most heavenly foot massage she’d ever gotten, and that’s when she started to think he was a little too perfect, like when perfect starts to melt down and become downright slickery and slimy. And so afterwards, she knew he was slimy because he rolled up close to her in the bed and said, I love your body, you are beautiful, blah blah blah, all kinds of romance that, even though it sounded like total bullshit, kind of made her heart flitter, or flutter, or titter, at least until he stopped beating around the bush, so to speak, and said that he liked women smooth, very smooth, and the smooth is best when it’s the <em>smooth waxed smooth</em> all over the body, everywhere, even the most softest place there is, and did she know then what he was saying. Yeah, oh yeah, she knew what he was saying, but she was having trouble believing it. Could he really be that pushy and did he think she was just some kind of object-fantasy like some porno chick who looks like a prepubescent whore or did he really believe those nice things he’d been saying—and they actually got in a huge fight right there in his bed, and she stormed out with the perfume he’d bought her and the coupon for ten dollars off the next bottle that came with it.</p>

<p>“I can’t decide what to do,” she said. “He called me last week and he was all apologizing and calling me bella but not in a corny way, and saying how much fun he had and all, and finally he said didn’t I know I could do whatever I wanted with my body, and I thought. Cool. I can try this again. But I’m not sure. I’m just. Not sure. What do you think?”</p>

<p>Jenna thought, visibly, with Myrianna, in that ostensible way that women can think together, while staring into each other’s eyes, as if their brains are parallel processors or redundant disk arrays. When the necessary computing was complete, she started giving advice. Myrianna listened, mostly, interjected something now and then, usually a something that raised my eyebrows, and I pretty much tuned out for a bit, until Jenna said, “What do you mean you already did it?”</p>

<p>Myrianna said, well, she went ahead and got a full wax done anyway.</p>

<p>I stopped my tinkering. “Holy cow,” I said. “You did that for him?”</p>

<p>She said, “No. I didn’t do it for him—” and then cut herself off.</p>

<p>I started to ask something else, but then just looked deep into the circuitry.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I did go to Myrianna’s bedroom, but I tried to get out of helping her put on that necklace. I offered instead to place it on the dresser, and without waiting for her reaction, politely took leave. That was when she turned to face me, her fingers spread and suspended in front of her breasts which were only partially concealed by the gown she wore. Again, vapors of something distilled, and not just perfume. I grinned about that, now, decided to bring it to her attention that it was no secret from me. “So, have we been pre-partying?”</p>

<p>“It would be really nice if you could help me.”</p>

<p>I tried not to stare between her slender painted fingernails at the outline of a nipple tweaked by thin fabric. “Ah,” I said, and grinned again, now fealing queasy once more. “Might not be appropriate.”</p>

<p>She looked perplexed. </p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m not totally comfortable with that. With helping you put this on.”</p>

<p>“Help me out, Chad. Don’t be weird about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not weird,” I said, still grinning. “I mean, not feel weird.” She had turned her back to me now.</p>

<p>“What the hell,” I said. I held it up over her head, lowered it, let it rest against her collarbones, brought the ends of it back. I was very careful not to touch her. There were fine hairs, colorless, lying flat in rows from her hairline down her neck. Her tan shoulders had clusters of tiny faded freckles. She was giving off heat like a halogen lamp. The necklace had four small hooks and four things that could only be described as claspers. After struggling quite a bit, I had to scoot closer, rest my knuckles on her neck to get the proper hook angle on the first clasper. A vertiginous drop, down her narrowing back. Her skin was molten.</p>

<p>“Can you just do it without being icky about it?”</p>

<p>I explained that it was harder than it looked.</p>

<p>“I feel like I’m being molested.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. I told you I wasn’t comfortable—”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. Just get it on.”</p>

<p>One of the freckles was darker than the others. The necklace slipped, one clasper slipped. The weight of it tugged the other clasper from my hand, and I watched it slide out of side, down her front side. She stiffened and gasped. I imagine the silver was cold on her skin. She gasped again. It was caught on the inside of the fabric, not in a place where I could reach for it. I don’t know why I thought I should keep watching it there, maybe to catch it if it happened to fall out.</p>

<p>She fluttered her hands at her shoulders and exclaimed something about vintage-wear-be-careful-it’s-an-heirloom-piece, meaning the dress and not the necklace. The whole accident caused a momentary contortionist dance between the two of us. She leaned forward; I curled around her. She turned sideways; I strafed to keep up. My hands reached out, ineffectually, avoiding contact while still trying to recover the thing, in essence, doing nothing but reaching out to hover just in front of her. Finally, she had to lie on her back on the bed to get the thing unhooked from where it clung to the inside of the fabric.</p>

<p>To that date, we’d never done anything remotely illicit. Other than the hungry looks. And the one time we’d both had too many at her house and, passing between living room and bathroom, had a hands-on collision that sort of turned into an embrace in which she decidedly planted her face against mine and hungrily devoured my lips for about four seconds, even going so far as to wiggle her tongue once between my teeth. Other than that, nothing technically illicit.</p>

<p>I was still helping get the thing unhooked, but at that point I was sort of on top of her, on the bed, which made things more difficult. Then, in my pinchings and shiftings of the slithery sequin fabric, as I attempted to expose the necklace without actually groping her body parts, one of her nipples slid forth. Erect and with a slight horizontal crease, it seemed to be winking at me. The areola was surprisingly brown, the nipple so engorged that I simply found myself sucking it, without thought or premeditation.</p>

<p>At some point in what followed she said, “This is such a bad idea. We really should stop. But you have something with you right?”</p>

<p>“No, why?”</p>

<p>All of our clothing had come off at that point. At least, everything but my own vee-neck undershirt, which I like to keep on no matter what. And my chestnut-striped socks because I don’t like to have my feet get cold. On the other hand, Myrianna had very quickly made her birthday suit the only thing between us. With two humble, gently probing pope fingers I explored between her sveldt legs and found that the smooth had definitely been waxed smooth, just as Alfa liked it.</p>

<p>Her face was incredibly close to mine, her expression conflicted as I continued my exploration. “Uh, yeah. If this is happening, you most certainly need to use one.”</p>

<p>“You’re on something though, right?”</p>

<p>“Uh, yeah. Yeah. But so what?”</p>

<p>“I mean you didn’t tell Alfa to wear one, I bet.”</p>

<p>Irritation flickered across her expression. “Ew. Why would you bring him up? Yes I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you did, then we probably don’t need to worry about diseases or anything.”</p>

<p>“Uh no. We most def need to.”</p>

<p>“You’re serious.”</p>

<p>“You need to use one.”</p>

<p>“Do I really?”</p>

<p>“Yes, really.”</p>

<p>She was reaching into the nightstand drawer. “I have one here.”</p>

<p>“You do? You keep them here?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, silly. This is so wrong. I can’t believe this.”</p>

<p>“Are you gonna help me get it on?”</p>

<p>I was only half-joking. Knowing Myrianna, I figured I would get a smartass response to that. But to my surprise, she said yes. And she did, expertly holding that little rubber trampoline in place with the right side facing out and then unrolling it for me as far as it would go. I was relieved: I didn’t have to struggle with it or figure out which way it was supposed to unroll. She seemed relieved, seeing it go on. I just had one adjustment to make, before we started.</p>

<p>“Chad.”</p>

<p>“Hold on a sec.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were right in front of me, staring at my face. I met her gaze solidly as I shortened its coverage a bit. Just enough so it wouldn’t block <em>all</em> of the sensation. Halfway up, at least, then a bit more, to about 70 or 80 percent up. It was only fair to leave just enough nerve endings exposed to make a full connection down there, as long as the thing was performing its overall function.</p>

<p>“What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p>“Hang on. Just one sec. I’m just &#8230; getting it adjusted.”</p>

<p>“What’s to adjust? It’s fine.”</p>

<p>The anatomy of a circumcision is very convenient when using this particular technique, as it provides a nice backstop against which to roll up nearly 90 percent of the whole condom. There it could stay battened against the storm, still serving its main purpose but allowing nearly full contact. She was trying unsuccessfully to look down there as I made the final adjustment, so I reassured her it was on securely now, which was true. She said it definitely needs to be on one hundred percent of the time, no question about it. I said of course. She asked if it was on right at that moment, and I said yes, which was also true. She tried to reach down there; it slipped in. Her eyes got wide. It had unrolled again, with the entry, so I backed out just a bit, using the friction to roll it back up just far enough, to its snug top position. Then I probed forward.</p>

<p>“Chad, stop!”</p>

<p>I stopped moving. Our eyes were still locked.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s on, right?”</p>

<p>“Sort of.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, mostly.”</p>

<p>“No, that&#8217;s not going to work.”</p>

<p>“Well I have to move again if I’m going to fix it.”</p>

<p>I moved again, forward and back, a few times. Her carefully painted nails dug in to my arm as her other hand pushed at my hip. She looked concerned, not pleased. “Chad.”</p>

<p>I moved some more. “Yeah?”</p>

<p>“Fix it.”</p>

<p>I backed out just an inch. “It’s on, it’s just rolled down about halfway.”</p>

<p>“Could you just show me before you do anything else?”</p>

<p>“In a second,” I said. “Just a second.” </p>

<p>“No,” she said. “Now. I need to see it.”</p>

<p>I said, I know, but just a second. She said no. I said: Right now? In the middle of this? She said yes, that would be the key time for her to be sure I’m not lying. I said fine. And I meant it. I started to back it out, slowly. There was a certain level of tension all over her body, and down there was no exception. I was noticing an exceptionally resonant and amplifying electrical connection along the whole length of my prolonged retraction which went directly to that part of my brain that deals with such things and somehow transforms them into the most blissful state of existence we can ever know. And for some reason, with just that very small deliberate motion taken just a bit farther than I wanted but almost as far as she wanted, something happened.</p>

<p>“Oops.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Oh my god. You didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I was just starting.”</p>

<p>I was out and reaching down, felt a moist absence of it, and then getting a visual, saw that, indeed, it was gone entirely.</p>

<p>“You did.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing happened.”</p>

<p>Now she was making a face.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. You did this.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no.”</p>

<p>I stood up. “It was an accident.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she said, discovering some wetness on her hand. “Oh no, no, no!”</p>

<p>Now she pushed with both arms. Pushed me away, hard. And to think: it had been her pulling me onto the bed in the first place! Next she was running out of the room. “Oh no,” she was saying. “Oh, no. No. Shit.”</p>

<p>I followed into the hall, holding myself. “It was just too good,” I said, trying to inject some levity into the situation. I had to allow a bit of a smile. It was obviously an accident and both of us were responsible. I followed her to the bathroom but she stopped me at the door and then closed it in my face. “It was too exciting!” I called through the closed door. I heard her washing off at the sink. Then the shower came on. I knocked, telling her to calm down. “You’re acting hysterical!” I shouted. I shouted some other things, mostly about how we should just enjoy it for what it was. “Where’s the afterglow?” I yelled. I yelled more things. Then I gave up and walked into the living room, pacing for a bit. I looked into the patio glass and saw my reflection, holding myself, and beyond it, in the dark yard, I was sure something shifted, but when I walked up and pressed my face to the glass, I saw nothing but silent shrubs.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Two black guys, also in suits, but pinstripe gray with flowers at the lapels, and bright ties, one pink and the other turquoise, with fedoras on, come up to the bar. One of them has a growth of grey stubble and the other has a mustache and thick-rimmed glasses. They’re not young. Lined and sagging cheeks, noses shiny and veined like the varnished handles of a dresser drawer. Julia goes over to them, leaning in a little.</p>

<p>The Xtra Light has gone to my head, and I’m ready to let bygones be bygones with Renaldo. I try to strike up a chummy non-work-related conversation with him, one that won’t set him off.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with your mom?” I ask.</p>

<p>He looks at me for a second. Then he says, “Cancer.”</p>

<p>“Oh really, what kind?”</p>

<p>“None of your business.”</p>

<p>We both watch Julia serve the two pinstriped men. One orders a bottle of fErvess Gold and pours it with a hand covered in gold rings into a tall glass. The other gets a bourbon on the rocks. We both watch Julia pour it, her elbow up with the bottle, spout aimed into the glass just inches from her t-shirt.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if you had a problem with me,” I say. “I actually think I’m good with people in the office.”</p>

<p>Renaldo takes a sip and without looking at me says, “Well, you’re not, but that’s okay.”</p>

<p>I contemplate this incorrect information, debate with myself whether to correct him or not.</p>

<p>But then he says, “It doesn’t matter now. I’m sorry I said that about you there, but you’ve always taken this confrontational attitude with me. I never understood it.”</p>

<p>I don’t say anything to that. I’m fairly sure I don’t need to have therapy time with Renaldo right now. There’s no need to get touchy-feely.</p>

<p>That’s the problem with people like Renaldo: they just want to talk about their problems rather than fix them. I wasn’t about to sit there and start complaining about how people weren’t nice to me at the company I worked for and isn’t that a boo hoo shame.</p>

<p>Renaldo, I want to say, We work together. I don’t though, because now it’s not true. You don’t have to be the best of pals with the people you work with, You’re there to get a job done. Renaldo has never understood that. From day one, he treated the job like a social commitment, always trying to get people together, always wanting everyone to get along. Until the last day, that is, this day, when he decided to sneak off by himself without telling anyone. How did Stephanie know he came here on Fridays anyway? He must have invited people along. He never invited me, though, and I’d never heard of any of them gathering here for Happy Hour. If they did, I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Renaldo’s phone goes off, and I listen to his end of the conversation. “Hi. Yeah, I’m just having some food. No, just me. Probably a few more hours, I don’t know. No, it didn’t happen. Because the investors backed out. The company shut down today. They’ve locked the doors.”</p>

<p>On the TV: STATE FORCED COLLECTIVE IDENTITY / INSTITUTIONALIZED SHAME IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR FREE WILL / IT IS AN ILL USE ON OF FREE WILL, IF YOU WILL</p>

<p>On the stage, the two men in the hats and pinstripes arrange a few chairs, along with another man, a severely skinny white guy with a shaved head and wire-rim glasses in a black sportcoat with a blue silk shirt underneath it, no tie, and a pair of black slacks with shiny black shoes. There are instruments and cases among them, and a set of drums being carried on piece by piece behind them, near the burgundy-brown curtain, on which is a stenciled likeness of Struggles, one eye open one eye closed, as usual.</p>

<p>I’m no longer concerned about Renaldo hearing my intimate conversations. I pull out my Moto. This time I speed dial her without delay. It’s time to talk, even if it involves emotions. The phone is ringing for her. Jenna needs to know all this. I’m thinking I’ll tell her exactly what’s happened, why I’m really here. I’ll tell her how it all went down, and she’ll comfort me. It rings a second time. I try to imagine her reaction to this news. It’s not the initial reaction I’m worried about, but the extended one. The conversation that happens in bits and pieces over a week, maybe longer. But in this case, I need the initial reaction. I need something other than indifference there.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I could wait till I get home. It would be better to tell her in person.</p>

<p>Surely that would be better.</p>

<p>In the middle of the next ring, I hang up.</p>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<h3>THERE I AM</h3>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<p>I don’t believe in keeping secrets. Not for very long. I’m not a secret-keeper, one of those precious higher-ground sorts. I believe everyone should take responsibility for their actions.</p>

<p>That Sunday, it had been a week and a half since that unfortunate tryst, which by then I realized was a complete and total seduction by a skilled seductress, bereft of all morals, insatiably pushing boundaries into a manipulation so complete that I lost all sensibility. And it was all so disrespectful of her good friend, my wife. So potentially ruinous of that “girrull-frandship,” that I had to wonder what she had been thinking. Or whether she had been thinking at all. Perhaps her whole lady-self was consumed that night by a frothy soup of uninhibited lust, a toxic brew that took the oxygen away from her brain cells.</p>

<p>By the time I’d decided to tell Jenna about it, when the circumstances were perfect—Sunday afternoon, in our comfortable home, at the end of the long break from the daily stress of work, after a morning of Red Barn pancakes and a walk around the neighborhood—I knew exactly what I would say. I was actually fairly certain it would blow over very quickly. That there would be some surprise, some squalls of anger, but then a clear sky of understanding. Jenna, for once, was not remorseful about quitting Arlensin, as she had been for weeks. She was content with the idea of becoming a domestic goddess. And I was hitting my stride in my new role as breadwinner.</p>

<p>The timing was perfect: I chose to tell her as we sat on the couch, reading the advertisements for Deucey’s. A strong positive reinforcement there. Deucey’s: a shared vision of department store bliss. Whenever we shop together, we shop at Deucey’s.</p>

<p><em>”Now that’s the price it should cost!”</em></p>

<p>The day the execs started okaying italics was the day Deucey’s cornered the market on off-brand everything. The sections of the store whisper in lowercase&#8230; . <em>for your yards</em> &#8230; <em>for your bath items</em> &#8230; <em>for your messies</em> &#8230; <em>for your closets</em>. You’d never expect the mouthwash with the viscosity of dish soap to actually work. They have two previously unknown brands of paper towels. They have space organizers made in China, out of human hair. And the most forgotten fact about Deucey’s is that they also sell clothes—</p>

<p><em>for your outfits!</em></p>

<p>I put down the bedroom &amp; closet section and drew a deep breath. “I have to tell you something about Myrianna,” I started. But for some reason, it came out as a Deucey’s whisper, and I had to make myself say it again, in a normal voice.</p>

<p>The second time I said it, Ethan started mewling, and Jenna quickly stood up. A ripening odor, at first attributable to the leftover, cold, garlic mashed potatoes we&#8217;d all had, was developing into what was most certainly Ethan’s own smell. The unfortunate effect of this precocious attention grab was that I was unsure suddenly of whether she’d heard me at all. She stood up in the middle of what I was saying and swept Ethan from his blanket. Then she rushed off to the kitchen. All I could do was stand and follow, calling from behind that I had a small confession to make. Not even a confession, really, just an admission.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” she said. “It looks like he really made some major poo poo this time.”</p>

<p>She laid a towel across the countertop of the kitchen island. At first this practice seemed unsanitary to us, but in the relentless vigilance of raising a child, we finally realized something. It&#8217;s just natural. As long as the germs do not touch the countertop directly, we reasoned, it was worth the added convenience.</p>

<p>I had, I told her again, something to admit to. She moved Ethan over to the towel, rested him on it. Something, I said, which was not at all much of a secret but which until this point had seemed better to keep quiet.</p>

<p>“Uh huh,” she said, getting the box of BabyFresh MoistDabs from a cabinet and placing it on the counter, next to our fruit bowl.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat. “Well, the other night.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?”</p>

<p>“The other night when I took that necklace over.”</p>

<p>“Yeah right.”</p>

<p>Her expression was very strange, very strange indeed, but I pushed on.</p>

<p>“Well, Myrianna wasn’t really getting ready for a date.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Right.”</p>

<p>Now I could see: her expression was one of anger. How could she be angry before I told her what I was about to tell her?</p>

<p>“What do you mean, right?”</p>

<p>“I mean, I know.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Of course. She said it was a dress rehearsal.”</p>

<p>“Well. It was a bit more than that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really? How so?”</p>

<p>Then I told her that I slept with Myrianna.</p>

<p>She laughed. I wasn’t totally sure it was a laugh, but then she thought about something, with an angry face, and laughed again. And that time I was sure. She was laughing at this admission. Which made me sure, actually, that she had not heard correctly.</p>

<p>She pulled out a handful of MoistDabs, laid them on the counter. She clearly wasn&#8217;t listening, hadn’t heard clearly, something. “No,” I said, going over to stand next to her and Ethan’s invisible cloud, “I said I <em>slept</em> with Myrianna.”</p>

<p>And she said, now with obvious irritation, “Yeah. I know. I’m laughing that you would call it that.”</p>

<p>I tried again. “Yeah,” I said, “Right. But what I mean is that Myrianna and I actually—”</p>

<p>“Right,” she said, unfastening one side of Ethan’s diaper. “I know.”</p>

<p>She thought she knew. She was just not hearing what I was saying. So I used a little technique I learned in management training at Motomoto. I slowwwed wayyy dowwwn, and said: “Okay. Right. Well why don’t you just tell me what it is you know.”</p>

<p>She unfastened the other side.</p>

<p>“I know she&#8217;s dealing with a lot of personal trauma from it. And so am I. But obviously I can’t talk to you about it.”</p>

<p>It’s not easy to leave me at a loss for words, but I was struck silent for a moment. She was doing her best to appear nonchalant, and yet she knew how surprised I was. I had to confirm one more time what she’d clearly reiterated several times. “You know this already. You know about what happened.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>We went back and forth with that for a bit, incredulous me and nonchalant her, trading Qs and As until I demanded a full explanation. I demanded that she explain how she knew all this already. And her explanation was simply, “Myrianna and I are best friends. We tell each other everything.” And she looked up at me and had maybe the saddest look I’ve ever seen on her face. And I knew it was not something I could fix.</p>

<p>Her hands went slack on the edge of the island, leaving Ethan to flail, soiled. She folded a MoistDab into a triangle, her preferred wiping shape, took his ankles in one hand and swabbed at his messy rear. Slipped the interestingly streaked MoistDab into a plastic bag.</p>

<p>“Actually, we&#8217;re still processing it together. We’re not even sure what to call what happened. So we haven&#8217;t decided what to do yet. And that’s really all I want to say about it at this point.”</p>

<p>“You two are deciding what to do.”</p>

<p>Ethan squealed as she wiped again, vigorously this time, under his burgeoning balls. She put him onto a pristine diaper, and shrugged, saying, “It’s hard, isn’t it? Not being included?”</p>

<p>Had the whole discussion ended there, a lot would be different now. Maybe. I like to believe a lot would be different. But then again, a lot would be different if Myrianna had never been part of the equation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the rest of our little talk that afternoon went from tense to agonized, and the day stretched into an agonizing evening in which thoughts and feelings crescendoed into an unbearable overload on my mind, and, presumably, hers. And through it all, never once did she deviate from the absurd position she was taking on the whole thing, that somehow neither she nor Myrianna knew exactly what happened.</p>

<p>That night was the night that ended in the La Panoche hotel room for me.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Of course, we smoothed things over. For awhile. The move into the new house had focused her on other things for most of the fall, and the winter had lulled us both, with a kind of soporific comfort and self-indulgent bliss, as we separately enjoyed our new abode. It was not until her birthday, in April of this year, that things devolved again, particularly into another rather shocking, finger-pointing shame session, at the SeaExperience exhibit in the Miami WeatherDome. What a trip that was. Mainly because of the epic disagreement we had that lasted two of the three days we were there. Add to the mix a hungry baby with no breast milk available crying the whole time in a hotel room and you have quite a celebratory vacation to kick off a new job.</p>

<p>It was in the AquaFun Bar over gin fizzes (and Xtra Light) that she summarized her grievances with one word for me: <em>patriarch</em>. Had she not shouted it loudly several times in the bar, causing many strange-faced Cuban-looking fellows in suits to look over mid-puff on their cigars, I would not have minded. But I did mind.</p>

<p>What the word meant, exactly, was comically vague, especially when I tried to pin her down on it. And I did try to pin her down with it. “But no,” I insisted, “What does it mean? What does that term really mean? I mean it literally means father, if you look it up.”</p>

<p>“No it doesn&#8217;t,” she argued.</p>

<p>“It does! And that’s a <em>good</em> thing! I’m just can&#8217;t see what all the negative associations of that word are for you!”</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;No word with &#8216;-arch&#8217; in it is a good thing, Chad.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought about that, and conceded her point. Diplomacy works.</p>

<p>Then, the anniversary dinner, in June of this year. An evening of infamy. And like so many things, it seems like just yesterday. Smorga’s Boardhouse &#8230; The dim wooden interior, the meat-loafy smells.</p>

<p>On Wednesday nights, and Wednesday nights only, Smorga’s Boardhouse features a buffet with one exceptional bonus: the SmorgaSack take-home allowance. It is the only buffet I’ve ever been to which allows the taking-home of leftovers, no questions asked. And only on Wednesdays. And no questions asked means exactly what it says. “Are all of those salisbury steaks on your plate really leftovers, or are they just extras?” No fear of them asking that. Likewise, I will never ask them: “Why do you guys need to get rid of so much food on Wednesdays?”</p>

<p>That night Jenna wore a haunch-hugging beige skirt, nude hose, and caramel-colored pumps. I have to admit, I admired her rear end as I followed her down the hall to the utility room and into the garage where the Beamer sat at the ready. And again as she strapped Ethan into his car seat. I even gave it a goose, couldn’t resist. I knew she needed some attention. It had been a rough year, at that point, since I&#8217;d come clean with her about Myrianna.</p>

<p>It had taken some convincing on my part to persuade her to allow Ethan to come along. I said forget about paying that sitter from the down the block a ridiculous sum just to sit around and watch our big screen TV all night. “Ethan is family,” I said, “And why shouldn’t he celebrate with us? If he was twenty, you’d want him to raise a glass to us, right? Don’t exclude him from the fun.”</p>

<p>“You shit,” she said. And I laughed. I can take a joke. Always with the jokes.</p>

<p>Even on Wednesdays, Smorga’s Boardhouse still retains the semblance of wait service, restaurant experience—and that’s important. You are shown to your table by a high-school-faced girl with maybe too much lip gloss or just enough to overstimulate a potentially illegal fantasy. You are seated, handed menus, then very shortly greeted by a college-faced girl who wears lipstick, all grown-up-like, and seems a bit more savvy about the exploitative job she has. It’s at that point the pretense of dining—that you are about to order several courses after poring over the written menu and then double-check the computer’s math on the final bill before you shell out way more than you expected—disappears entirely.</p>

<p>The college-faced girl informs you that it’s $7.99 for all you can eat from the buffet, should you choose that option, or you can order from the menu, but the buffet on Wednesday night offers the additional option of the take-home allowance, which is just what it sounds like. It costs an extra $1.95.</p>

<p>At that point in the process, I’m already nodding. It’s worth it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t a Wednesday night.</p>

<p>I’d protested, hoping to reschedule the anniversary a few days forward, to a day that was not actually the anniversary, but Jenna insisted that she wanted to order from the menu for once, and that this dinner had to happen on the exact date of our anniversary. She said it like there was some great significance. “It’s just another day,” I protested.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said, sensible as always. “But this time it has to be the exact day.” The home-made Swedish meatballs were their specialty.</p>

<p>The discussion in the Beamer on the way there was hardly festive. Though we are always calm when discussing our marital issues. We have extreme objectivity. It was civil. But the nature of it was not exactly celebratory of our years together. Suffice it to say it had something to do with my urges, how I went about satisfying them, ways that I supposedly coerced her into a certain lifestyle, or a certain role, situations when I exerted an unfair amount of power in order to swing larger circumstances in my favor, or if not in my favor, to satisfy some kind of domestic fantasy of mine. She portrayed me as a sort of fiend, really, a born father figure bent on shaping everything in his own image, in accordance with his own ideals, at the expense of everything, including domestic balance, security, privacy, comfort, convenience, and peace of mind.</p>

<p>Well. I told her she’d been reading too much of her Moaning Mewls-LeJunk, too much wacky po-mo theory, and she should go back to her old Acc’y textbooks to see how the world really goes around. Part of the blame lay on Myrianna, too, and I did also point that out. To think that I would sacrifice security etcetera for some kind of self-indulgent male urge-factory was absurd. I&#8217;d made a mistake. And over the year since I&#8217;d done that, I&#8217;d acknowledged it again and again. To her. And I&#8217;d done nothing but give Myrianna the cold shoulder since then. I think the ways in which I attempted to snub her were quite commendable. It wasn&#8217;t my fault she kept stopping by the house and getting invited over and calling all the time and occupying Jenna behind locked doors in whispered phone conversations that I couldn&#8217;t even hear with my left ear pressed hard against the door. We should have gotten the hollow core doors, and maybe I would have a better understanding of what allure Myrianna had for Jenna. For the first time ever, I regretted splurging on the new house.</p>

<p>Apparently, the evening I’d delivered the necklace had become a wildly distorted tale between the two of them, in which I was a sort of drooling, groping sex fiend as I delivered the priceless heirloom. In Myrianna’s telling, apparently, I invited myself in, followed her back to her bedroom instead of waiting in the living room, and began to paw at her bare shoulders before she was fully dressed. I was some sort of a horn doggie who warped the situation toward my own satisfaction. And Myrianna apparently went so far as to tell Jenna she’d struggled, tried to discourage me, ultimately felt powerless against me, and was afraid to truly fight back, a victim of my advances. What could I say? Especially in the comfort of the Beamer, while Bartok played softly, a stereophonic rendition by the Wurttemberg Philharmonic Orchestra, swooning with delight, and tiny flecks of snow evaporating just as quickly as they speckled the windshield. On the way to our anniversary dinner. The webs we weave!</p>

<p>The girl who seated us had a nametag on that said just Yoli. S: somehow that was the first profoundly disappointing aspect of the whole night. She was over-cosmeticked, in a slightly trashy way, and her hair was permed. She had one of those bodies shaped like a gourd, where she’s all face and neck plunging into a tiny frilled white shirt and then suddenly her hips and trunklike legs are everywhere below that. But I tried to enjoy myself. Her ungainliness became a fascinating study in fluid dynamics as we followed her to our table. Her rump was shockingly round and active. I observed her Smorga’s standard-issue maroon slacks, belted tightly above the two ballooning buttocks which alternately rose and fell as we made our way through the dining area full of vapidly gazing patrons chewing on meat. The slacks were unfortunate. They tapered with her enormous thighs all the way to her knocking knees, but then fell flaring and baggy, bunched up on her black Jorgens TampSole Restaurant Special sneakers. At one juncture when we all had to navigate around an enormous man in a chair, I motioned for Jenna to go ahead of me, and compared the two physiques, my slim wife and her eggplant corpus. Quite different. Once, way back in seventh grade, my art teacher, a certain loon named Mrs. Biddleworth, showed us a series of photos illustrating typical body types. The photos were grainy black-and-white shots of rather pasty, middle-aged men in dark briefs. None of them looked particularly healthy, but they definitely had widely varying body types. As I recall, the types were ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph. The ectomorph was a gawky, tall man with horn rims, the mesomorph looked like my high school wrestling coach, and the endomorph was your typical large-size computer programmer or gamer body type. Someone who let himself go and then never looked back, at himself. This comparison, between bobbing rump that defied gravity and trim derrier showing a faint thong line in a loose skirt, was definitely endomorph vs. ectomorph.</p>

<p>Though Jenna is too short to be an ectomorph. She, like the mesomorph, conforms to what the Greeks called the golden rectangle. Although for women, it might be a triangle. Point is, rather perfectly proportioned. Except for her short arms and slightly broader than desirable shoulders. Not that they’re monstrously misproportioned or anything. Just a bit wider than you’d expect for a woman. And, to be fair, without their unfeminine breadth, they would not emphasize those wonderful collarbones of hers. And her thin neck. I count my blessings.</p>

<p>We were seated a little too close to the restrooms for my liking, and near the kitchen too, with me facing the wall, which bothered me so much I asked Jenna to trade with me, so I could survey the scene. She didn&#8217;t seem to mind, so we switched places. &#8220;You&#8217;re okay staring at the wall?&#8221; I asked, after taking her seat.</p>

<p>“The wall, your face, whatever,” she said.</p>

<p>It was not their buffet night, I pointed out again, but the upside was that we would be splurging. I was excited by the idea. We would be ordering from the regular menu, appetizers and all. It’s an unusual thing for us to order appetizers. Jenna has been known to order a salad early on and then watch me eat an entree, but in general we both want to get food in front of us quickly and then dispatch it to our stomachs, as quickly as possible, to ease the general discomfort of being slightly hungry. That does not, in our book, mean appetizers. Appy-<em>teasers</em>, I call them. A waste of time and money that only leaves you thirsty for more Xtra Light. </p>

<p>“Well,” I said, taking her small hand. “Isn’t this nice?”</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand. As she smiled, at a woman at the next table, I took something from my pocket, careful to keep it concealed in my hand.</p>

<p>“I want this to be a memorable day,” I said. “So I have a little token of gratitude.”</p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes. “A token of gratitude for our anniversary?”</p>

<p>“For you. On our anniversary. To show my gratitude, yes.”</p>

<p>I didn’t find it so strange, but she was laughing, at something in the way I was expressing it.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’re grateful that we have an anniversary? Is that because another year has passed, or because you like celebrating anniversaries?”</p>

<p>She was teasing too hard. I shook my head, shook it off. “Don’t be silly. I’m just giving you a gift … to show … to show that it’s our special day.”</p>

<p>“I already know what day it is,” she said, and laughed again. “You’re saying you have a gift. That’s all you’re saying. Just that you have something. Nothing more. Right?”</p>

<p>Oh, she was having some fun. True, at my expense. That was fine. I could allow that, especially on that day. What I was trying to express was simply a sense of celebration, that I wanted to make a celebratory gesture, and to give her something she would remember. It didn’t come off very well, I admit, but I was trying.</p>

<p>I was explaining it again. I went through the whole preamble, and finally got to the part where I told her to think back, think back down memory lane, and recall the Regal Amber showcase, at the Polish Galeria we visited on that trip to Buffalo for her grandfather’s funeral. Recall the feeling she had on that day, looking at the amber showcase in the Regal Galeria.</p>

<p>She perused the menu.</p>

<p>“Jenna. Hey.”</p>

<p>Then, just as I was asking her to recall looking at a certain item in the display case, a short girl with pigtails approached the table so aggressively she actually bumped her hips into it, slightly spilling my ice water, didn’t apologize, and introduced herself as Amber-our-server-tonight-would-we-like-to-hear-the-specials?</p>

<p>I was thrown off. Not only was the server’s name in direct conflict with my preamble and story, confusingly redundant, but she was going to be the type that constantly interrupts you at the worst moments for the whole meal. I wagged a wait-a-sec index finger at her. She looked fearfully eager. But I was stammering, and didn’t get very far with the story, because whenever I said Regal Amber, I was forced to look at pigtailed Amber, anything but regal. And Jenna kept looking up from the menu as perplexed as she had been from the start, saying “Which galeria? Where was it? Near the market? And which thing was I looking at?” But mostly she was just looking at the menu.</p>

<p>“Do you guys need a minute?” Amber asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“We’re ready to hear the specials,” Jenna said.</p>

<p>Amber then launched into a rote recital of what the specials were, concluding with, “And the meatballs have been called the best Swedish-style meat-meatballs in the greater Chicago metro area by the Chicago Reader three years in a row, and in case you’re not familiar, they’re basically just very big balls of ground meat that are, uh, stewing in this, like, brown sauce, I mean Swedish gravy-sauce, with carrots. And home-style dumplings.”</p>

<p>With that, I left the little jewelry box I’d been presenting next to my placemat, and focused on drinking some of my water.</p>

<p>I never did get back to presenting her with it. I was getting the not-so-subtle impression that she didn’t want it. But then why did she want to go out on the anniversary dinner at all? The year before we’d done Imbroglio’s, down on the Riverwalk, and it had gone much better than this was going. It had even ended up with a little naughty mutual spanking later in the bedroom.</p>

<p>In fact, this year she acted very strangely the whole time. And Amber was not much of a help. She poked her nose into every attempt at conversation up until she went AWOL entirely, and no amount of waving my empty beer glass at her could get her to look, although a busboy named Tito seemed eager to keep my water glass filled to the brim the whole time.</p>

<p>Jenna was distant, I concluded. this was not new, but I didn’t expect it on this occasion. Then, while feeding Ethan a tortellini from a Kylie Jensen ergo-pack container, her eyes came up to look directly into mine. She was going to say something, and at that moment I was enjoying the whole experience so immensely, the fake electric fireplace behind her, the medieval music being piped in from above, the little Mexican boys carrying out hot dinner rolls, the tink of glassware and soft coughing of fat older gentlemen, and the delicious smell of Swedish home fare, that I could not have been more caught off guard by what she said.</p>

<p>She said: “I want a divorce.”</p>

<p>Now, I had heard similar words, but not those exact words. In the course of any marriage, conflicts can escalate to points that provoke mewling protests and pleas for escape, and it’s not that unusual for one spouse to occasionally express regret, confinement, disgust, repugnance, fear, or just a general urge to be free of the partnership, in addition to the usual unhappiness that often leads to strife in the first place. Both of us at some point had given voice to the impetuous and irrational urge to be free of one another — to get out of this, as it were. But the words I was hearing were what computer programmers would call Reserved Words. They were functional, built-in command words. There was an imperative built into them. You didn’t get to the point of using them without really having a deep need to use them. That said, I called her bluff.</p>

<p>“You heard me, Chad. Don’t ignore it. I mean it.”</p>

<p>I smashed a fingerling potato with the butt of my fork and then pressed it with the tines, watching it squeeze between them. “Did Myrianna put you up to this?” I asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with sudden anger and she bristled up. “What if she did? What of it?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think she’s a shining example of how to hold together a marriage.”</p>

<p>“Hold together?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it takes effort. And it’s a two way street. With ups and downs, and bumpy patches. And stop signs and sometimes wrong turns.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to talk about it. We can just eat this meal. It will be our last anniversary meal together. I just needed to tell you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll work it out,” I say.</p>

<p>She said nothing. She began to eat the large swedish meatballs that Smorga’s Boardhouse is known for across the whole metro area. She ate them with a pouty face, the way that little neice of hers will eat her fish sticks after she’s been told to cut them with a knife and fork instead of stuffing them in whole. While her face took on that <em>hm-hm, well excuuuse me</em> look, she said, “It’s not just about me and you.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Ethan here has a say.”</p>

<p>Neither of us looked at Ethan though, not in that moment. Embarrassment is self-inflicted, usually, but in that moment, ours came from shame.</p>

<p>“Ethan is going to stay with me and Myrianna.”</p>

<p>“Myrianna,” I said, stopping my fork midway to my mouth. “What does she have to do with it?”</p>

<p>“She’s had a hard time. The divorce, then what you did.”</p>

<p>“What I did?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What did I ever do to her? She seduced me.”</p>

<p>“She did not seduce you. Believe me, I’ve heard all about it. I’m the one who’s been helping her through the pain.”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard all about it? What did you hear?”</p>

<p>“Myrianna and I are quite close these days.”</p>

<p>Of course — I pictured them toucing each others knees, squealing in unison. “What’s new?” Then I tried to imagine them both nude, groin-grinding each other, on a bean bag surrounded by cats and parakeets. You get the point — it was an absurd, impossible thought.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re understanding,” Jenna said. “Myrianna and I give each other the emotional support that we haven’t been able to find anywhere else. We’re committed to each other.”</p>

<p>“What the heck does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that I’ve helped her get through all this. And she’s helping me. And we’re emotionally committed to each other, as partners.”</p>

<p>“Partners in what?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to move in together. And we’re both done with men, for good.”</p>

<p>I laughed. “I suppose you want me to think this was all because of me, of something I did to Myrianna.”</p>

<p>“It’s because of you, yes.”</p>

<p>“She’s a big girl. I don’t see what’s taken her so long to get over it. The whole thing was a mistake. We’ve gone over this again and again.”</p>

<p>“But honey,” she said. “You <em>raped</em> her.”</p>

<p>I glanced nervously at the family next to us. A moon-faced kid was watching us while the father snapped fingers at him and the mother shoved pork into her baby. I smiled at Jenna, teeth clenched, telling her in a whisper-shout to, <em>keep her voice down please we are in a public place and fat people are looking at us!</em></p>

<p>“It’s true!” she said. She waited for me to gather my thoughts on it, because truth to tell, I was tongue-tied, and in the meantime, she sliced a meatball in two and forked one half of it into her tiny mouth and began to chew triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I mean,” I said, still keeping my voice low but shout-like in its insistence, “That’s a, like a, totally insane word. Talk about an extreme, extreme description of something that, something that was just a mutual mistake, actually something she instigated, that she wanted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she asked for it,” Jenna said. “Right.” And she shoved a whole meatball in her mouth.</p>

<p>She ate a total of six of those big Swedish meatballs at that meal, more than I’d ever seen her consume in one sitting. Blatant symbolism if I ever saw it. You can&#8217;t blame me for that. Before I was even finished with my veal strudel, she walked out of the place, leaving me and Ethan to stare at each other. She spent the rest of the time waiting in the car, believe it or not. I looked at Ethan and he looked at me and I carefully slipped the small box, in which sat her gift of Regal Amber, back into the safari pocket of my Dickers.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Renaldo lights another cigarette, and the disgusting cloud of his smoke begins to drift around my head.</p>

<p>“Did you two want to order food?” Julia asks. “I’m about to close my shift and I need to cash out.”</p>

<p>“We’re not together,” Renaldo says.</p>

<p>“You can still share mine,” I say, but he asks for his own. Julia walks down to the other end to get my beer.</p>

<p>On the front of the menu is the story of Arnold Wunder. It’s a story I find very inspiring. Here was one of the meatpacker tycoons, who lost his entire empire to government regulation, and—hard to keep a good man down—reinvented himself as a skid row restauranteur, at first only known among Packingtown hobos but soon catapulted to fame by a puffed-up New York food critic who, seeking a new taste, found Wunder’s Wurst Diner and tried “the finest wurst a body ever did nibble.” Today, he has a new empire: Wunder Bars in every major city, a marvelously effective advertising campaign featuring Struggles, whose brown paper sack holds secret spices—the seeds for a new rise to fame. It’s all so entertainingly clever that it makes me hungry. The categories on the menu are: Hobo Grub, Belly Filler, Rooty Tooty and Swills.</p>

<p>When Julia brings my beer, I tell her I’ll have the veal cutlet with spaetzle.</p>

<p>“As expensive as it is,” I say, “Going to take the plunge.” And I give her a wink.</p>

<p>The veal cutlet item costs $13.99, an outrageous amount of money to spend on a meal, especially from the bar menu, and more than I’ve spent on beer so far. But in this case, given the circumstances, and so Renaldo can see I’m capable of something other than the tight-fistedness he expects, it’s okay.</p>

<p>And Renaldo is still looking at his menu. “Still undecided,” I say. And in a friendly gesture, I recommend several things to him. I describe the item that I’m going to order. I ask him some questions, trying to determine what he’s in the mood for. I get no acknowledgment that he’s heard me at all. Not even a nod. Not a hint of any kind of expression on his placid goat-bearded head. Down the bar from him, a man raises a tenderloin sandwich to his lips, extending a pinky on either side. I suggest to Renaldo that he try the tenderloin; it looks fun. I ask him if he even eats meats, presumably not. He gives no indication either way. “Are you a pescatarian?” I ask him. Then I tell him the fries are good. I tell him he can order the onion rings, or just do a salad. I tell him that’s probably more his speed, a garden salad. Some anemic iceberg lettuce and a pale tomato with a pungent slice of onion on top. Nibble on that like a sick bunny. </p>

<p>“Can you hear me at all?” I ask finally. Then he turns his head. Away from me. I think I hear him say: “No.”</p>

<p>Julia comes back down to us, looking only at Renaldo. “Did you decide?” she asks him.</p>

<p>He shakes his head and hands it back, and Julia goes over to the register.</p>

<p>“Excuse me!” I call. She’s futzing with something at the register. “Julia!” Then she comes back over to my spot at the bar, and without a glance at me puts down a little shot glass with a ticket in it. She starts to walk away. I call out to wait and she stops short. She waits while I fish out my Cashback Card and drop it in. I’m not sure but I think she’s making a face of some kind. Then she starts to carry it off but stops short again. “We don’t take this,” she says, holding up my card.</p>

<p>“You don’t take Cashback,” I say. “You’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m kidding.”</p>

<p>“You are?”</p>

<p>“No. We really don’t take it. Mr CARD, Passport or AmXtra.”</p>

<p>She places it on the bar.</p>

<p>“But I get cash back on Cashback,” I say, looking at Renaldo with a what’s-with-this expression. He looks away and shakes his head, maybe even rolls his eyes. Julia blinks. “Just let me know when you find a different card,” she says, and goes to the register and starts reeling off tape. </p>

<p>I put my Airpoints Mr CARD in the little glass. I have ten thousand miles to go before I get a free economy class ticket to any of the 48 contiguous states. Not as good as cash, but still satisfying.</p>

<p>The bar continues to fill with new patrons. Bears fans, merc traders, smartly dressed women striking casual poses in their no-frills attire. Renaldo appears to be attempting to accelerate his smoking. He now has a permanent, widening cloud in his area, as if he’s earned the right to become his own smog-filled metropolis. Or a sea-spawned invading monster. The way he’s smacking the surface of the bar from time to time is his own Godzilla’s tail. Julia mixes with fervor, the South African business men are winking at her, and the band has just stopped for a brief intermission, which has somehow taken the overall volume of the place up, not down.</p>

<p>I think about my place in this world, and this feels right. I am one of these people taking part in the whole thing. Each one is important in some way. Adult. We’re all adults, doing adult things, to the world we live in.</p>

<p>When Ethan is big enough to walk and talk, he will be the kind of little boy that waitresses pay extra attention to, that women in the street will stop to touch, for whom teachers will forsake objectivity, for whom other parents feel an inward pang of envy. He will have one of those radiant smiles that no one can resist greeting with kind words, and he’ll possess the manners of a young gentleman and conversational skills that put even the most child-wary, socially uncomfortable adult at ease. Policemen and firemen will wave to him from their vehicles, will let him wear their hats, and he’ll take it in stride like a diplomat. Amongst cynics he will inspire hope; amongst evildoers, repentance. No one can fault me for too much love here. I only want the best for him. The most I can hope for is that he becomes a man who somehow inspires people to please him, commands them in the same way that he holds sway over Jenna. She feeds him big people food now, and he makes it very clear he likes it that way better. He’s ready for big people things. Food, drinks, cars, discount items, accessories, loyal brands, the world itself. It will collapse on him like it’s collapsed on me, but he’ll rise from the chaos. He’ll be stronger than the world, and that’s all any father and mother can hope for from their son. He’ll be a strong example for his younger sibling.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see the truth of all that, in the way the skin is taut, the way her belly button is deeper than usual. The way, from the side, that the curve of her abdomen no longer runs exactly parallel to the curve of her spine. Now it’s a deeper curve, slightly deeper. But only slightly. Ethan will never feel alone.</p>

<p>There must be some way to always say or do the right thing. In any situation. It comes naturally to some people, without conscious thought, from instinct, maybe. I’m not sure I have that kind of instinct. There must be another way to hit upon the ideal verbalization in a given situation. Think it through, like chess. In this one, for example, with my own wife, I don’t know what move to make. With my own wife!</p>

<p>Of course, it’s complicated, because she’s angry. She’s been angry for a long time and now it’s come to this. I do have some instincts, but fortunately, I know better now than to follow them blindly.</p>

<p>Just last month she took to locking herself into our bedroom for long bouts to try on weird outfits. “Jenna,” I plied recently, softly, knocking, softly, rapping on the door. It was her door now, not ours. But these things are temporary. We’ve worked things out before, and we’ll work this out just the same. “Jenna,” I said, knocking. And I did hear her voice, faint, maybe facing away, saying either right now or not right now. “Right now?” I asked, loudly. And waited. And then I heard her loud and clear. “Not right now.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, not right now?”</p>

<p>Then her voice, muffled, saying she had to get ready.</p>

<p>“I have something to tell you,” I said.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“It’s important.”</p>

<p>Then her voice, very loud, right on the other side of the door: “Can you wait until a worse time, when I’m more rushed maybe?” Then a loud thump.</p>

<p>“It’s about NDC!”</p>

<p>Of course I wasn’t going to tell her what I need to tell her now. But there had been early warning lights. The engine light was on, usually no cause for panic, but worth noting. And possibly worth pointing out to your passenger. Or so I thought, in that moment.</p>

<p>A series of thumps, then a drawer opening.</p>

<p>“You already told me, the outside contract, and I already knew about it anyway!”</p>

<p>I started to say no, no, this was something new, but I held my breath for a second, then knocked loudly. Of course I didn’t know then what I know now, that NDC was finished, completely, done for, but I knew some things, and I knew what some of the possible outcomes were. And sometimes, I needed her advice.</p>

<p>“Can you please just let me in so we can talk?”</p>

<p>There was silence. Then the door opened.</p>

<p>“What is it? You have about thirty seconds.”</p>

<p>She was nude from the waist up, wearing a partially fastened skirt and holding a camisole in one hand. Her other hand was on the door, ready to close it in my face.</p>

<p>I stammered something. I don’t know why the sight of her bare breasts always takes my breath. In any case, it made it difficult to look her in the eye, as the occasion required. Normally she has a degree of modesty about such things. We do not normally converse in the buff. I muttered an apology, told her I could wait a few minutes until she was decent. She said well, apparently it just couldn’t wait, so out with it now. I said no, no, it could wait a little bit, but I definitely need to speak with her. She said fine. The door closed, and I wandered back to the home office, lost. I sat there for awhile staring out at the leaves in Mrs. Bayer-Whyte’s yard, the ones their Mexicans had missed. I may have sat like that for awhile.</p>

<p>Then she emerged from her front door, ready for her run. She propped one leg up on her front steps as she extended the other out behind her, deepening the crease under one buttock. I watched her do her stretch routine on each leg. Then she sprang across the yard and bobbed off down the street and out of sight. And although I continued to think about her, on that day none of the thoughts really interested me. It was a strange thing. An odd feeling.</p>

<p>Some more time passed while I sat there motionless. The next thing I noticed was a large vehicle pulling into the drive, and soon Myrianna was walking up the front walk carrying a small box. Her hair was either fully encrusted or still wet with gel and she seemed tense, her face gaunt and her chin out-thrust. She wore high heels, a skirt slit up the leg. Probably had a thong on. Again, the thought didn’t interest me, and that was strange.</p>

<p>“Jenna’s not dressed,” I said, when I answered the door. “Properly.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” She looked away and then at me, and then narrowed her eyes. “Can I come in?”</p>

<p>“I guess.”</p>

<p>I walked away and told her to close the door. She did, and then she had the nerve, as I tried to get out of her area, to ask what my problem was. I stopped, turned, informed her that I have no problem at the moment, but if she was feeling particularly hopeful, I could let her know as soon as one came up.</p>

<p>“That might be the smarmiest thing you’ve ever said to me,” she said.</p>

<p>She walked over to stand in front of me at a not-so-safe distance and was frowning. In what could have been either a husky or hushed voice, she said, “You and I need to have a little talk sometime. But maybe not right now.”</p>

<p>There was something new in her eyes. Maybe it was just that she hadn’t been around so much in the new house as she was in our old one, or maybe it was the fall light, or just the feeling of winter coming, but it was there, something new. It wasn’t good though. It was fear. She was afraid. Of me! She even seemed to be trembling. This had not happened, ever, not even after the event which can only be referred to here on out as The Seduction.</p>

<p>I took a few steps back. I don’t know what came over me, but I couldn’t bear to look at her anymore, and I stayed where I was but studied the carpet, the bunched fibers, the outline of a footprint that I’d left in the swollen surface moments ago.</p>

<p>Then she went into the living room and Jenna appeared from the hall. She was holding her cell phone and wearing an outfit that made me forget the discomfort of seeing Myrianna. It got my blood pumping again. Instead of the see-through sari she&#8217;d been trying on earlier, she sported a cornflower blue stewardess blazer, a frilly navy tie, a white blouse haughtily unbuttoned one button too far for office decorum (in its V, a strip of her white lace bra visible), a gray skirt, nude hose, and tasteful black flats. She was wearing, I noticed, her Aimee Moss watch.</p>

<p>“Hey girl,” Myrianna said.</p>

<p>“I’m almost ready,” Jenna said, in a mock pleading tone, with furrowed brow.</p>

<p>They embraced. I watched Jenna&#8217;s hand, the left one, wedding-ring-less, with its sensibly clipped nails, cling to Myrianna’s back for a moment. Her cheek was against Myrianna’s gelled hair. Her lips were glossy. Myrianna’s hair was glossy. Jenna’s eyes were closed. And then I saw: Jenna was not happy. Not that this was new information. Not that I didn’t know it. Just that seeing it here, in the context of a hug that lasted far too long, with too much facial contact, was in itself a revelation of a bigger kind of sadness than I think either one of us have ever known. This entirely unnecessary hug lasted three seconds too long not just because they were “girlfriends,” but because Jenna was terminally unhappy. And that had been the case for longer than I suspected.</p>

<p>“Wow,” Jenna said, doing a vertical scan of Myrianna’s body. “You look great. Maybe I should wear something a little more &#8230; something.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I think you look fine. I mean, maybe lose the tie.”</p>

<p>“Really? Maybe a choker instead?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go see what you have.”</p>

<p>They swished off down the hall. Myrianna had left her mysterious box on the credenza. It was thin cardboard, folded into shape like a Chinese takeout box. There was no label on it. I looked at it for a few moments and finally decided I wasn’t curious about it at all, that I already knew everything I needed and wanted to know, and wandered back to my home office. Outside, the sky was dark with clouds. Mrs. Bayer-Whyte was still out. There was no telling how long she’d be out, but it had never been less than an hour. I sat down. Gusts of cold wind, from the northwest, were jostling the little branches on the maple and buffeting Jenna’s plot of prairie grass. She has three plots, the one by the front step and two in the back yard. But the one in front is the showpiece. It’s the one she calls her “posse from the old homestead.”</p>

<p>The office computer had gone to sleep. A letter from a law firm was sitting on my desk. I didn&#8217;t really need any more coffee, especially not with RonPico in it, but I went to the kitchen and brewed another pot anyway. When the Brue General started to make the slurping sound, I filled a coffee thermos, the Motomoto one (<em>I survived HR Rapid-Ploy commencement</em>), to the brim, added a dash of the old Caribbean medicine, screwed the lid on, and wandered out of the kitchen, into the hallway, directly to the bedroom door, to place my ear firmly against it.</p>

<p>“&#8230; good?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I like that. Oh my god oh my god.”</p>

<p>Giggling.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?”</p>

<p>“&#8230; Deucey’s, of course!”</p>

<p>“Oh my god, Deucey’s, I always forget they have clothes!”</p>

<p>Both engaging in some murmuring, and then Myrianna.</p>

<p>“This is amazing.”</p>

<p>“ &#8230; pilk &#8230;”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you wear it with the pleather pants.”</p>

<p>“&#8230; the red ones?”</p>

<p>“No the brown ones.”</p>

<p>“ &#8230; hey &#8230; really goes with that.”</p>

<p>“And then you wear the yellow jade—”</p>

<p>“—the necklace—”</p>

<p>“Yeah, and those boots.”</p>

<p>Then I heard Myrianna say my name. Or the word sad. Jenna said she thought something was really weird, and she couldn’t stand to be something, or do something, and someone wouldn’t tell her anything, and then Jenna said Myrianna knew how something was, how you ask something, how things go.</p>

<p>“&#8230; the one on York road that I went to?”</p>

<p>“&#8230; or that was the other one.”</p>

<p>“&#8230; the best. But &#8230; ”</p>

<p>A pause. I press my ear into a burning sensation.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Actually &#8230; probably get you in right away. He’s just got this really &#8230;”</p>

<p>Now Myrianna deliberately lowered her voice. Top secret stuff here, for sure. Wouldn’t want old Chad to know anything he already knew. About himself. Wouldn’t want him to know about himself. From anyone else. Would we?</p>

<p>Myrianna worked herself back up to a certain volume: “&#8230; had been there, and she was like no. And I was like are you totally, totally sure?”</p>

<p>Jenna asked a question but I couldn’t hear it.</p>

<p>Then Myrianna, gravely, “She said no openings at all for seven months.”</p>

<p>Silence. Then Jenna, “Seriously?”</p>

<p>“Seriously, girl.”</p>

<p>Something slammed against the door, a cannonball perhaps. I reeled away, holding my ear. I quickly prepared a small speech, in case the door opened. I&#8217;d never known Jenna to throw anything out of anger, but the last week or two had brought a lot of firsts. It could have easily been a Springwalker, just removed from her tender foot and still warm inside. I heard the word motherfucker, uttered by my wife, strung with other words too indistinct to make out. I heard Myrianna repeat the word, questioning. Something about time. Her tone was gleeful. It didn’t seem that the door would open. Must have just been a convenient target. No knowledge of my presence. I pressed my ear against it again. Immediately, though they couldn’t possibly be aware that I was listening, they both lowered their voices to soft murmurs. I heard the word bar being bandied. Then they returned to their normal speaking levels.</p>

<p>“And who was he at a bar with?”</p>

<p>“Who knows. By himself.”</p>

<p>“He does that?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Sometimes.”</p>

<p>“He’s probably listening at the door right now.”</p>

<p>Silence. I straighten up, take a few steps away and pretend to be adjusting a photo frame on the wall, just getting it straightened &#8230; then I go back to the door.</p>

<p>Murmuring.</p>

<p>“&#8230; needs a babysister, not Ethan!”</p>

<p>“&#8230; and we take him to your mom’s.”</p>

<p>“&#8230; should I worry about him?”</p>

<p>“&#8230; gonna be just fine by himself &#8230;”</p>

<p>“&#8230; don’t even care &#8230; time to get away from him &#8230;”</p>

<p>“&#8230; downstate &#8230;”</p>

<p>Then, just last week, I got a call at my desk from Stephanie. Someone at the elevators to see me. It turned out to be a little Mexican woman in a plaid shirt, holding up a wallet with a badge in it in one hand and an envelope in another. She grimaced at me and I saw a gold tooth.</p>

<p>“You been served, man.”</p>

<p>“What is this?” I demanded, but then she was gone, in a whiff of what must have been cologne and not perfume, leaving me alone by the elevators to open the large envelope and read a document, on letterhead from a legal firm called Scintilla &amp; Storm, notifying me of divorce proceedings. Also in that letter was a veiled insinuation of a hint of a threat that if I didn’t somehow provide an “amicable response,” the “investigation could be extended to certain aggrieved third parties, who may in turn decide to file unrelated charges.”</p>

<p>I was, and still am, incredulous. We live together. We eat together. She’s carrying our new child. And now I have a deadline to remove my belongings and myself from the house, or fight the whole thing. And all because of Myrianna. And I never did anything different to Myrianna than I ever did to Jenna!</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Look, I tell me, in the mirror, You don’t belong here. No one is going to join you here. You belong at home with your wife. Your wife is the only constant companion.</p>

<p>And yes, maybe it’s time to go home. Your face is looking more and more like Renaldo’s, like the guys that bug you for change when you come out of the Red Rooster with the Sun-Times. You’re the whole reason Renaldo got hired. You’re the Monday absence that allowed him to appear. You’re the seeming randomness in his life that he probably attributes to Karma. You’re slouching over the bar now, just like him. There are two of him and two of you, and two of two. There are two of us. Without Renaldo here, I would not be here. I would be at home. But Renaldo is here, so I’m here. Is there some other reason for being here?</p>

<p>All this makes sense, at least to me.</p>

<p>The Sunday night that ended in La Panoche, I was sitting at a bar looking at myself in the mirror, just like I am now, when instead of facing myself I should have gone home and faced Jenna. And on this night it’s because I don’t want to tell her what’s happened, and on that night, I didn’t want to face the two of us. There I am and there I am.</p>

<p>I am not a drinker. I do go to bars on rare occasions, but I do not go to bars for weakness, I go for courage and strength. Marriage is not for the weak. And by the way, my wife and I do not argue. Sure, we have disagreements. Marriage is a compromise. It takes strength and resolve and humility to compromise. I drink out of humility. Our parents taught us that we can learn to get along, that there is no place for selfishness or pride. That giving up is not an option. Instead of giving up, I go for Sunday drives. This kind of humility is a small necessary allowance. It’s encouragement to return. On that Sunday night, I went for a drive way out west into the cornfield boonies of Northern Illinois. Around eight, I doubled back. I was already regretting being gone so long without telling Jenna where I was. But as I drove through Streamwood I passed Plucky Ducky’s, and as the brightly lit square of the Plucky Ducky’s sign, with its squat cigar-smoking duck in tophat and spats carrying two frothy mugs of beer, approached in the Beamer’s windshield, it occurred to me that I didn’t have to go to home yet. It was a bar that held good memories of holiday reunions with good friends from the high school wrestling team. Peanut shells on the floor, and darts, and pitchers of Xtra Light and pinball. I thought stopping in there I might run into someone from old SHS. I thought I’d see someone who would shake my hand, pat me on the back, send me on my way.</p>

<p>I turned around again. And had there been someone from the glory days, the evening would have turned out for the better. But instead I knew no one, and it was half as crowded as it was the time I encountered Donald. Which is to say about four people instead of eight. Two nitwits playing pool, a droopy desperado at the bar, a few jagoffs in a booth. It was Sunday-night-empty. I bellied up far enough from the droopy D to avoid conversation, and tried to console myself with just one Xtra Light.</p>

<p>Five beers, three jukebox songs, and one Ducky’s Italian Beef sandwich later, I realized that drinking out of fear and weakness, like a college kid, was not going to fix anything, and that, coupled with a comforting memory of the last time I’d imbibed here, was the logic behind switching to the MacSkirlin 12-year oak-barrel scotch.</p>

<p>As I said, I do not drink hard alcohol. But whiskey does not count, just as cigars do not count for smoking. And I normally am not extravagant. I save my money. If I do have a whiskey now and then, it will be from a bottle of Cousin Jack’s that has been in the cabinet above the breadmaker for three years. Paying thirty-eight dollars for four tumblers of MacSkirlin 12 was not my most frugal or temperate moment. I had only planned on one, but the stuff was so smooth and so comforting that I couldn’t stop and pretty soon things got downright Christmasy. They fuzzed over at first, and then they got a deceptive crispness. Very good whiskey can do this, or so I’ve heard. I began to feel braced and slightly sober. It was only when getting up to leave that I had a quicksand moment, catching myself on the bartop with the full length of my arm. What a long day! I believe I said that out loud. Not that I’d been at work or anything, I said, but church, the Red Barn Pancake House, the Bears losing at Dallas, the argument with Jenna in which she called me a megalomaniac, to which I responded that I wouldn’t allow her to belittle me with big words because I knew what they meant and probably knew more of them and bigger ones than she did.</p>

<p>What an afternoon, what an evening! I smiled and waved at Ducky the bartender, who had nothing to say and didn’t even bother to stop turning his towel in the glass. Now, how tired my legs were, how alert I would have to be for the drive home. At last I heard Ducky call out something. I waved off the offer of a cab, made my way to the door, into the parking lot. The Beamer sat isolated in a spot away from the powerlines. I only had to park under powerlines once to learn my lesson from those crows, and now, looking over at the cluster of lines disappearing into the trees, I congratulated myself, out loud. A brown couple huddling in their coats looked at me from the sidewalk. “A clean Beamer is a Sunday Beamer,” I said, not to them, but while looking at them. “A Holy Beamer!” I shouted after them. I wove my way across the sodium-washed lot, which was far more unevenly paved than I’d noted coming in. There were treacherous upheavals of asphalt, cracks to negotiate, crabgrass that threatened to topple me. But I made it. The La Panoche sign burned high above the trees. That’s an idea, I thought: I pictured passing out on an aggressively sprung bed; waking at dawn and stepping into a steaming shower; ironing my Sunday slacks and driving straight to work with a cup of hotel coffee. It sounded nice. And maybe just thinking about it was what made my body shut down; all of a sudden, the fresh air only seemed to parch my throat: dregs of whiskey-flavor went bile-sour. Out on the road, tail lights stretched out like hot gum. I pulled out my phone to call home. I’m just not the kind of person who leaves his new car outside of a bar all night. That is what I told Jenna. It took a few tries, to get it worded right. She began insisting that she drive the Dominator to pick me up. I wouldn’t tell her where I was. I told her I would sleep it off in the back seat after I moved the car to a safer place. “No, no no,” I said. “No protests. Enough times protesting for Sunday. Time to rest.”</p>

<p>I pulled into fast traffic for one blinding moment. Someone’s horn spun past as I took a hard turn into the La Panoche lot. I parked it just outside my room, where I could watch it with a close eye.</p>

<p>The La Panoche room had a phone book. I’m not sure what I was thinking when I called Palace Girls Escort service. A husky woman’s voice answered. “How much do you charge?” I asked. I knew that she knew I didn’t have a clue.</p>

<p>“How much do we charge for what?”</p>

<p>“Companionship,” I said, winking, and then realizing she wouldn’t see the wink, and adding, “Wink wink.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a girl in mind?”</p>

<p>This threw me. “Oh,” I said, the phone almost slipping out of my hand. “It’s not you?”</p>

<p>“No honey, I’m just the matchmaker.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well I don’t mind which one. But if you could make her negroid.”</p>

<p>A silence. Then, “Excuse me?”</p>

<p>“A black girl,” I said. “Could you send a black girl?”</p>

<p>I have never paid for sex, never even had the thought cross my mind. I’ve heard stories, at alumni reunions, of <em>pivo</em>-soaked Eastern European escapades, of whiskey-dicks in jack-shacks and premature ejacks in Amsterdam red rooms. All of the stories about real paid sexual exploits are pathetic, and nothing at all like the porny Miami hotel room hijinks of action movie bad guys on cocaine benders.</p>

<p>My best explanation in retrospect is that I was testing myself. Actually, my best explanation is that I have no explanation. The La Panoche rest stop happened, the phone call happened. The rest happened, but not what the critics would expect. At the time, I didn’t think about my actions, but now, I know I was just testing myself. And guess what? I passed. With flying colors.</p>

<p>The girl who showed up was a short girl, thick in the middle, with poorly covered acne scars and stretch marks around her armpits. She was wearing no jewelry at all and had a blond wig on.</p>

<p>“My name is Sassy,” she said, throwing her purse on the floor. She was most certainly black, as I’d requested, but not exactly what I wanted. I was expecting something more along the lines of a black everywoman, someone who looked like they could have their own talk show, more of a Mavis Dinty type, tastefully bejewelled and coiffed, slim but still rump-tastic in an executive pantsuit. This woman looked sloppy, a little impatient, tired, and completely resigned, as if she immediately knew she was wasting her time with me.</p>

<p>I told her, delicately, that I was no longer exactly sure about this.</p>

<p>“Mm hmm,” she said. I admit, the memory of the ensuing conversion is very hazy. In short, I said that all things considered, I’d made a mistake, and what did she need to get home? There was some eye-rolling, very dramatic sighing that somehow involved her whole body, and mock disgust. Or anger, I wasn’t sure which—but nevertheless it did not seem genuine. As if the whole thing wasn’t already disgusting, and could have been more so. And it was too early to get angry except in order to impress upon someone else that something was not agreeable.</p>

<p>I asked her if she wanted a drink from the mini bar and her demeanor changed considerably. She happily accepted a Yeltsa Vodka, a MacSkirlin, and a Ronpico Gold over the course of our conversation.</p>

<p>“My real name is Lorraine and I have two kids to feed at home,” she said once she had settled in the beige easy chair in the corner under the hacienda painting. “And that’s as personal as I’m about to get with your ass.”</p>

<p>And then I think I proceeded to tell her a lot of things about myself. I asked her a few questions. Dumb ones, undoubtedly. I don’t remember what they were. She said she didn’t like doing this but it was good money and safer than the streets. She said my problems were typical white boy bullshit. She said you can’t ever know what kinda shit life gonna throw your way, so you best get out the way ahead a time. If you can. And if you can’t be doin that, get outta someone else’s way.</p>

<p>“You ain’t even love your wife,” she said. “I can see that a mile away.”</p>

<p>I said I beg your pardon and somehow accidentally slid off the foot of the bed. When I recovered my seat and my vantage of her she looked in some way, somehow, dainty, even though she was a far-from-small woman tippling an absurdly small bottle of hard alcohol while squeezed tightly between the arms of a faux-fancy hotel chair. I needed to hear something from her, because she was real. She was someone who must know, with the wisdom of the streets, something. With that nitty gritty, I imagined she’d call it. Although when I asked her to give me the nitty gritty, she gave me a puzzled look. I clarified for her. I explained: I respect people from all walks of life, even if down on their luck. Even if they are baring their flesh for money. Even if they are allowing the body parts of desperate characters to go inside their own bodily openings, repeatedly. Even if they are then passing the proceeds along to some fly-by-night company that advertises sensual companionship from gorgeous models. I respect the situation of such people. And I was grateful that she went into advice mode that night. I needed it, and I needed it from her. The memory I have of that conversation is one of complete satisfaction. Of an uncontrollable urge that is utterly vanquished by the positivity of a sequence of human interactions. No clothes were removed, and neither of us moved from our spots, her plush esconcement and my wobbly perch. Nothing illicit transpired. But on the whole, it felt like the greatest release of negative feelings I’d ever experienced in my life. And that was something. It really did feel like the first time I’d ever relinquished all the control or semblance of control I had, or felt I needed.</p>

<p>I asked her how she kept going, how did she get up and face each day? How did she go home to her kids and tell them it was all worth it? But what I was really asking was: how could <em>I</em> keep going? How could <em>I</em> keep doing it everyday? How could <em>I</em> get better, so that <em>it</em> got better?</p>

<p>She shook her head, and I could feel her disappointment, in me. I can’t say I was very composed at that moment. It was unsettling to her, but she wanted to shrug it off. “You think I ain’t seen this before? Grown man bust out, cry like a newborn babe? Look, I’m a be straight witchoo. Cause I don’t even trip when it comes to this bad shit. You gots to find yo self one thing a day that you can damn skippy say gone do you some good. And you gots to be look forward to that lil nugget e’ry damn day no matter what else go wrong. It’s all them nuggets gone git you past the big bad shit. Know what I’m sayin? The big <em>boss daddy</em> shit. He one big control freak, that boss daddy. But shoot, you ain’t gotta be wary. Specially you. Look atchoo: you a little home slice. You look like motha fuckin Jo Bee Homeboy up in here. I believe you <em>wheel</em> keep on keepin. You <em>wheel</em> find yo self some new nare ass white bitch—sorry, I mean nare ass white <em>lady</em>—and I believe she <em>wheel</em> date you, and you <em>wheel</em> both get hitched, and she <em>wheel</em> give you more babies. No warys. Did you ever done thought: maybe you two ain’t meant to be together? Maybe all this gone be for the better? Sometimes the bad shit’s good shit, know what I’m sayin?”</p>

<p>I don’t remember much beyond that, but I fully admit at that point, I was engaging in some sort of highly convulsive sobbing activity.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lorraine.”</p>

<p>She watched me and continued sitting there, finishing the last sip and shaking her head, then finishing another last sip, and shaking her head. Then the last sip of the three bottles she’d been alternately tasting. Then some more head shaking.</p>

<p>But what was I thinking? I am not that kind of man, and I’m certainly not that kind of husband. I paid her, but only to leave: cab fare, plus the full amount of a “tip” that she specified, which I negotiated downward by a reasonable amount. But I did pay the full amount of the agreed upon sum. I did not stiff her, so to speak. It was definitely worth something, that in that my weakest moment of the night, I could still do the right thing.</p>

<p>I woke at dawn, as planned, but the room was spinning. I made it to the bathroom through a series of reeling maneuvers and chucked up a stream of hot gold. I grabbed a towel and wiped my face, realizing too late it was not a towel but a leg of my Dickers, which I’d apparently draped over the tub. With the smear of Italian-beef-flecked yellow on them, there would be no point in ironing. There would be no hot coffee, not for awhile. There would be no point in trying to go to work either, because for most of the morning, I couldn’t even walk.</p>

<p>Another bartender comes in, a heavyset guy with oily-looking black hair and a bumpy nose and white hairy arms. He starts serving people while Julia finishes whatever she does to close the register. Renaldo and I are watching her, and I’m finishing my beer a little too quickly. She disappears then, into the back. When she comes out, she’s put on a tight grey shortsleeve shirt and she’s carrying her Wunder Bar shirt in one hand, a pack of cigarettes in the other.</p>

<p>“I still think you sound Australian,” I say, as she walks out from behind the bar, past the two of us. Renaldo turns his stool to smile at her, and she gives him a weak smile in return and ignores me. She walks past the table where the two blue-suited guys are sitting and the one stops her by touching her wrist and saying something I can’t make out. She nods and says something back, and Renaldo is watching carefully. The man lights her cigarette, and after a few puffs, she pulls over an empty chair and sits with them. Oily-hair bluffly rings up my card and I sign, only tipping ten percent on the total since I’m not sure Julia will get it—and even if she does, I’m not sure she deserves it.</p>

<p>I watch the closed captioning again, set to a professor’s pontificating head: YOU CAN TELL A MAN TO DIVE INTO A HOLE, AND IF ENOUGH PEOPLE TELL HIM TO DIVE INTO THE HOLE AND HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT DIVING INTO THE HOLE, THEN HE WILL CERTAINLY DIVE INTO THE HOLE, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE WANTS TO DIVE INTO THE HOLE. HE MAY BELIEVE HE WANTS TO DIVE INTO THE HOLE, BUT THE TRUTH, NATURE’S TRUTH, IS THAT HE DOES NOT. AND THE MAN WHOSE HOLE HAS BEEN DIVED INTO, HE WILL NEVER BELIEVE IT EITHER.</p>

<p>Yes. Sometimes TV people can be so frickin right.</p>

<p>There’s a sharp rat-a-tat on the drums, like a firing squad, then a radiator hiss of cymbal, and a bass guitar bumping through the speakers. One of the two guys, the turquoise tie, is holding a guitar and the other holds a sax, and the tall skinny guy is at the drums. There’s a froglike woman at a keyboard now too. She does a little one-two-three number and looks at the drummer like he might be a bug. At the mike is a fat polack-looking guy with one tuft of hair on an otherwise bald head and sweatstains on the pits of his silk shirt, open at the collar to show off his blond chest hair. “Testing, testing,” he booms, then takes a sip from his Xtra Light.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they’re introducing themselves as the Southside Suzie-Qs, and then they launch into dull, monotonous blues music that Renaldo seems entranced by.</p>

<p>I turn around to face the rows of bottles and the tall mirror beyond. I don’t enjoy music. I don’t listen to it, have never been able to get into it. Except for Smooth Jazz and Wagner. Wagner is my wife’s influence, and Smooth Jazz is the only kind of music that really seems to fit my mood when I’m driving on my Sunday drives. When I go for my Sunday Drives, I tune in Smooth Hits 1020 and enjoy the sounds of the Don Lamonica Trio or Douglas Datwyler, or Voss Friswagon. Smooth stuff for a smooth ride.</p>

<p>During a pause in the Suzie-Q cacophany, I ask Renaldo if he thinks people didn’t show up because they blame me for what happened.</p>

<p>He shrugs, says in a lot of ways I interfered with the push for the early release.</p>

<p>“No way,” I say. I let my mouth hang open a little wider and nudge his arm, to make sure he sees how shocked I am.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he says, “You kept reopening old bugs.”</p>

<p>“Those bugs weren’t resolved,” I say.</p>

<p>“Well, regardless,” he says. “You wouldn’t let us roll the release until they were resolved. We could have rolled it as is.”</p>

<p>This astounds me, because it’s simply not true. I tell him: “I made it very clear that we would push it out this weekend no matter what bugs were still open. It wasn’t my fault that the backers backed out before we expected. It wasn’t like I had any power to do anything.”</p>

<p>“Tony suggested releasing on Wednesday, remember?” Renaldo says.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I say, “But the builds weren’t compiling because the CVS tree was still jacked. That was your job to fix, Renaldo.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he says. “Whatever. I don’t want to talk about it with you. I’m here because I wanted to be alone.”</p>

<p>In the mirror the two suited men stand up, and Julia is with them. She goes in back and they stand grinning at each other. Then she comes back out in a woven cap, with one arm in a trenchcoat and an unlit cigarette dangling from her lips. She doesn’t look at us as she follows the men out.</p>

<p>“We’re both alone,” I say.</p>

<p>Today for some reason he came to work wearing his backpack normally. He waited until the last day of the company’s existence to turn the thing around. Killing him would feel right, I thought at the time. I imagined strangling him with his own ponytail. But the only satisfaction close to that of strangling him was watching him grasp the situation. He stopped in front of his desk, picked up the pinkslip and stared at it for a moment, then looked around the office. He caught my eye. I nodded. Our build engineer Tony came back to his desk and sat down.</p>

<p>I pictured Renaldo going to Europe on his bonus money and shaking his long hair around in weird eurotrash nightclubs. I kept my eyes on him as he talked to Tony. The back of Tony’s head was shaking from side to side. Renaldo was making exaggerated tosses of his head, aghast, astonished: oh my, what a bummer, I imagined him saying. I thought: Shove that bottle where the sun don’t shine, hippy. My eyes followed his sauntering around the office, whenever someone new arrived and found their pink slip. An announcement came over the address system: we were all to convene in the lobby for some news. Torvin was going to lay out for people what he’d laid out for me. Renaldo spread his arms wide and smiled, saying, “We already know what that’s gonna be!” He was holding the fancy green bottle in one hand. Someone laughed derisively. Across the darkened office, people were shuffling through their desks, trashcans pulled from beneath. There was a continual sound of paper being dumped in them. Some of the messier people were just throwing their stuff on the floor because their trash had overflowed. I thought of calling Jenna right then, and, no surprise, decided to wait. I started copying another load of Renaldo’s MP3s from Kryton to a CD-RW. I had a 50-pack spindle and I planned on taking all of Renaldo’s music. At that moment, in that situation, it was the ritual I needed, and it was for him, not me, in case he wanted them after I erased everything from the servers.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I can’t believe what I’m seeing: two of the dark-suited and dark-eyed men have stood up and are walking toward Chicago’s finest and fattest. I swivel fully around to take in what is surely going to be a newsworthy event.</p>

<p>“Should we take cover?” I quip to anyone who might hear, assuming they’re all watching this phenomenon.</p>

<p>All the seats at the bar are now full; it’s standing room only for the other chumps at our elbows. One of them gives me a look of consternation, furrowed eyebrows, as he sips delicately at his AmberDraft bottled beer. I nod at him and jerk my head in the direction of what’s about to go down. “Right into the lion’s den,” I jest, raising my Xtra Light to this guy, who blinks at it.</p>

<p>The tallest suited brown sandal wearer strides right over to the cops, followed by the shorter, pudgier one, who I notice has donned a pair of sunglasses. I can almost hear the squishing of their sport sandals over the drone of conversation.</p>

<p>Then the unbelievable moment I’m anticipating, which turns out nothing like what I expected: the tall one has placed his hand on the shoulder of one of the seated officers, and the officer actually looks scared. He’s scared but he smiles. And the other one smiles too, and begins mechanically nodding.</p>

<p>Lip reading is not a skill I advertise frequently, since it’s most useful when no one knows about it. But since we acquired our latest big screen, we’ve discovered the beauty of closed captioning, and we’re grateful for it. It allows us to leave the TV on at all times, as a silent but colorful distraction, good for the occasional glance or impromptu vigil, but never commanding our attention when we don’t want to give it up. Especially with sporting events, where the Xtra Light and Mofitos ads are truly set many decibels higher than the main audio tracks of the programming. Surely if they knew folks like us were muting the TV because of that jarring discrepancy, they’d make an adjustment.</p>

<p>In any case, just last Spring, I began turning off the captioning too. I found myself paying more attention to the visemes that way. Because I had to. And when I needed hints, I could turn the captioning back on. But after hours of watching whatever was on like this, usually Joe Blusterfield or Nat Kandletamp, I began to acquire an ability to map visemes to the correct phonemes. It was a remarkable discovery, this skill. It suddenly projected voices right into my brain, even though the faces making those voices were silent, and seemingly distant. When something is silent, it’s farther away, and it makes you more alone. But not when it projects a voice right into your head. It’s very possible that sight-only listening is the only perfect way to receive voice communication. And it’s even easier to do in noisy bars, because everyone has to shout, which exaggerates all the visemes. So although the place is pretty noisy now with alchohol-fueled TGIF conversation, I can discern quite clearly what’s being said by the tallest man, who has a narrow chin, beaklike nose, and very low eyebrows. He has protruding front teeth and prominent lips, facts which make it easier to visually “hear” him, and right now he’s saying to the seated cops: <em>Network is fine. It will be coming online tonight. Yes, tonight. Proud of your service, Dick is.</em></p>

<p>And younger, less fat one nodding too rapidly, looking a bit fearful: <em>Well, okay, then you tell him that we’re proud to serve.</em></p>

<p><em>Sorry?</em></p>

<p><em>He said tell Dick we are proud. To serve.</em></p>

<p><em>You are proud as her?</em></p>

<p>Fattest one shakes his head: <em>Proud to serve. We are proud to serve our city and our mayor.</em></p>

<p><em>I will tell him that, sir. Meantime you can stay in bar, enjoy the band. When it is time, they will come to you. They will notify you.</em></p>

<p>We must always be vigilant. It’s a very suspicious exchange, this one. The easy feeling I had moments ago dissolves and a tightness creeps into my chest, up along my collarbones and into the back of my neck. There is hair on my neck that’s standing on end, I believe. I turn back to the bar, feeling all of a sudden like I should pretend not to have noticed anything, like something large is stirring under the surface of the floor, like somehow in watching that exchange, I’ve woken it. A sip of beer, a long one. A shot might calm my nerves, not that I ever make that a habit. But a shot &#8230;</p>

<p>“They auctioned off the IP,” Renaldo says, blowing smoke into his expanding ring, in which I’m suspended.</p>

<p>“Who did?”</p>

<p>He looks at me with what I could almost swear is sympathy.</p>

<p>“Torvin and the investors, the whole board. The investors wanted out that bad. Two hours ago, they held a kangaroo auction for all the intellectual property.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You can’t say you heard this from me, but I heard they’re naming you.”</p>

<p>“Naming me? What’s that mean.” </p>

<p>“In a suit.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What kind of suit?”</p>

<p>“A lawsuit, man. They’re going to fucking sue people over this.”</p>

<p>I’m speechless. Even if just a week ago I had been staring at a letter from a legal firm in my home office, debating whether or how to tell Jenna about it, a letter sent by the counsel hired by a certain rogue contractor, manuevering to get a cut of something big. Renaldo turns away then, clearly trying to indicate our conversation is done. As if he can drop something like that and just turn away! I even thought I detected a smile before he did it, and suspect he’s trying to hide it now. He continues swiveling in that direction, turning to whomever he can, which turns out to be the AmberDraft drinking guy, who’s been hanging around behind us the whole time.</p>

<p>“End of the world,” Renaldo says, to this total stranger, “Buy you a drink, man.” He swivels back to hail the bartender. “Whatever he’s having!”</p>

<p>A drink comes his way, something brown in a small glass, and he hands it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>I’m reeling, it seems, but trying to seem calm, I add “Yeah, friend, it’s on us. Drink up, <em>boob</em>.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p>“<em>Boob</em>. It’s Polish for <em>bub</em>. Never heard that? Means buddy, kind of.”</p>

<p>But really I’m saying boob, to him, calling him that name. And he has no idea. I raise my glass. I imagine, instead of clinking glasses with Renaldo, that I smash mine into his smug face. But he doesn’t even clink with me. He’s raising his glass to his own image in the mirror. So I wave my glass in the air toward him, toward his head, wave it very close to the side of his stupid face. Behind him, the lucky recipient of the shot raises it, and in the mirror I watch it tap the edge of Renaldo’s beer. And they drink. The two of them.</p>

<p>Jenna is right. It is hard, not being included. This news is surely incorrect, misinformed, false. It’s hearsay, from a hippie-tard who doesn’t know the first thing about how the business world operates. Doesn’t have a clue how real men negotiate in back rooms and make furtive deals to grab more than the next guy can, before it’s all too late. It would be astounding for Torvin to turn around and auction everything we’d worked on together, just hours after the board disbanded, without even letting me know. It would be flabbergasting. I can’t imagine what would make him turn his back on me after all that. I can’t imagine.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>From the Wunder Bar men’s room stall, I call Torvin and get his voicemail for a second time. I leave a long, rambling message that ends when my voice gets choked up and my eyes water.</p>

<p>“Torvin,” I say, “I wish you’d call me back.”</p>

<p>Seconds after I hang up, he does. It happens just as I’m drying my eyes with toilet paper that dissolves and balls up into dingleberries on my eyelashes that I have to remove one by one and will have to continue removing after I take the call.</p>

<p>“Torvin,” I say, staring at one of the dingleberries on the whorl of my index finger. Torvin’s voice is steady, as always. But unlike the sociable Torvin I know, this version of him doesn’t waste any time with niceties. “Chad,” he says, “I’m not talking to you right now, okay?”</p>

<p>“Torvin, first of all, yes you are.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not. Got it?”</p>

<p>“Torvin, I heard something from Renaldo—”</p>

<p>“Let’s just say I misdialed your number and you’re going to listen to me explain that I misdialed your number and can’t actually have a conversation with you. Okay?”</p>

<p>“But Renaldo said—”</p>

<p>“Just listen. I have about forty-eight seconds left. Our boardmembers are being sued by a South African company and it’s getting ugly fairly quickly. You’ll be receiving a letter which is part of something our legal team proposed in conjunction with Scintilla &amp; Storm. I’m sorry you had to be at the bad end of it, but it’s part of their overall strategy. If it makes you feel any better, T J Jillian is getting one too. Unfortunately I don’t have a whole lot of say in it. I have my own circumstances.”</p>

<p>“T J Jillian is trying to sue me,” I say. “He’s suing me already!”</p>

<p>“I can’t really comment on anything else. Like I said, the whole thing is getting ugly faster than a crone on her deathbed.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard that analogy. That’s horrible.”</p>

<p>He began to speak very deliberately, in a monotone, enunciating each word crisply. “The one other thing I can say is that I have been told there will be some mitigating factors. Don’t let the numbers scare you. But take them seriously. And understand, my hands are tied. I wish I could tell you more, but &#8230; please, just get a good attorney.”</p>

<p>“Torvin—”</p>

<p>“I can’t talk anymore, Chad. I misdialed. Sorry.”</p>

<p>I plead with him to wait, but he’s already disconnected.</p>

<p>I stare at the stall door, on which is another large Bubble Girls poster, this one promoting a bikini bubble bath event. On it, Klein-Gesellschaft Brewing Company branded above-ground swimming pools brimming with bubble bath are packed with bikini-clad bubble girls attending to mostly male bathers with trays of the new plastic mini-bottle size of Xtra Light fErvess (pronounced “effervesce”).</p>

<p>It’s from last June.</p>

<p>And this one Bubble Girl, the third from the left, looks just like Mrs. Bayer-Whyte. Mrs. Bayer-Whyte, the twenty-eight-year old human dynamo whose husband is away on business every other week. Like the pixie in this poster, Mrs. Bayer-Whyte has mere nubbins for breasts and a pair of cheerleader-quality gams, stout but well-toned. Her summer running outfit is tiny black and gold running shorts and a bare midriff top. My home office has a clear view of her front door. It’s a crucial view, one which I also enjoy on Saturdays while Jenna’s at the mall.</p>

<p>One day this summer, while Mrs. Bayer-Whyte was in the throes of her stretching routine, I casually strolled across the street and asked her exactly how much she runs on Saturdays. And she said, like it was nothing, anywhere between <em>twenty and fifty</em> miles. It’s astonishing to think about, really. The loneliness of being out there, just running along with yourself and hearing the air rush past your ears, for that long. It’s because of the seeming loneliness of it that I so relish the moment I see her come flitting down the sidewalk, thighs flashing and ponytail bouncing, right up her slope of lawn to the stoop, her neck all slick and her nylon shorts sticking to her rear. On hot days this summer, she used to run the hose over her scalp, then straighten up to let the water trickle down her skin as if she could drink it through her pores. Amazing. And in winter she wears gluteally-conforming track tights and a longsleeve shirt, equally tight and probably of some ultralight wicking polymer. Last winter she wore attractive little mittens, the kind that leave ladyfingers exposed. She did her limbering exercises in the driveway, and cut out the ones that required the ground’s resistance, icy as it probably was from the frost. Her cheeks in winter had a more chiseled appearance. Her eyes got more steely. There was high color in her cheeks, and more spring in her step. She likes to do a series of hops, and some pugilist-like in-place jogging, knees high, small fists pummeling. That done, she locks her knees and bends forward until her chest touches her knees, her elbows literally on the ground, fingers splayed against the concrete. Perhaps this coming winter I’ll put on my 1998 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon longsleeve tee (actually, it’s Jenna’s, but she spurned it because they gave her the XL). While Mrs. Bayer-Whyte’s husband is away, I could velcro on, really tight, my cross-trainers, put on a Bears stocking hat, and run, with great, really superb form, across the street, just as she gets ready to take off. I could explain that I’m starting a running routine and the merits of partner stretching are numerous, because you get deeper stretches, and you can isolate better. And hold longer.</p>

<p>The toilet paper dispenser requires some patience. It’s one of those large rolls in an extremely retentive plastic spool. I tear off about 30 squares in groups of two or three, folding them on top of each other as they come out. I stack them on my knee, and one by one, use them to carefully wipe my eyes.</p>

<p>T J Jillian is a distant cousin of Jenna’s, a fact that makes all of this harder to swallow. He was my last resort when the board nixed my implementation of the hashcrypting algorithm, after I’d unsuccessfully interviewed a series of lame candidates. My first conversation with T J happened, oddly enough, in a situation much like this one, on a covert phone call from a bathroom stall. And now, in a different stall, this whole thread seems to have come full circle.</p>

<p>Like most startups, at New Digital Controls we pretended to flatten the hierarchies of corporate oppression and break down the cubicle barriers. Torvin’s desk was right next to mine, in plain sight, with nothing to hide or dampen our conversations from each other. True, when one of us went to a conference room to take a mobile call, or make one, scouting missions were in order. Extra trips to the restroom, water cooler, kitchen; and ventured peeks through the glass windows, hurried attempts at lip-reading. Torvin made frequent exits to feed the meter, during which I think he also made phone calls, and these would have been opportunities for me to also make unnoticed calls. Problem was, this thing had to be done immediately, that day, and I couldn’t risk all the conference rooms being booked, or even having other employees overhear.</p>

<p>So, like now, I found the most private spot available, the men’s john. Even better, I went into the restroom of the floor below us, which was then the sales department of an Internet-based pet massage service. I ignored the curious looks of chiseled twenty-somethings who spend their mornings trying to coax New York dogwalking companies to partner up with pet masseuses through the PetRubs-dot-com online service. I locked myself in an unsullied, not-too recently used stall, unlike the one I’m in now, and I called T J.</p>

<p>The claim coming from another one of Jenna’s family members was that T J really knew his mojo when it came to encryption. When I called him, I should have known he would be difficult to deal with. I tried to compliment him by saying I’d heard in advance about his prowess. He was lippy about my word choices. He repeated the word as a question—”prowess?” I provided a chuckle. He sniffled like a juvenile who had a runny nose. I told him I wanted a hard core encryption expert to write an algorithm for us. He said “hard core?” I said yes, hard core. Then I said we could brief him and then he said “brief me?” I amended it to “de-brief you,” and he said “debrief me?”</p>

<p>Then he wanted to talk money, and I somehow yielded to him, even if I hadn’t explicitly agreed to his price. And then, hating myself for thinking it (and hating myself more now for having thought it), I thought: this guy is good. I agreed to his price. And he delivered the code. On time. He was as good at programming as he was at negotiating, it turned out. I presented it to Torvin, and the rest of the board. Dirk sent it to his code checker. The code checker approved. Everyone, by all impressions, was impressed. Just like that, I felt relieved. The matter of getting an algorithm that satisfied the board could be crossed off our list. It dispelled all leftover doubts about T J. After his initial lip and churlishness, it had been a smooth experience to deal with him. And even though I did claim his work as my own, in the big picture, I did the ethical thing. Sure, it wasn’t ideal, from a business standpoint. But we didn’t realize what was in the guy’s contract until after we’d signed him on. And we couldn’t fire him, because we didn’t realize our mistake until he was halfway done. By then, we couldn’t afford to start over either. It was a mutual oversight. We couldn’t have predicted that he would turn around and sell it to someone else. That kind of duplicity is exactly what NDC’s product was meant to stop. We couldn’t have guessed he might then try to sue me for handing it off to NDC, claiming infringement and asking for damages. The question now, for the lawyers, was: Who else did he sell it to? And what were they doing with it? And why? And how were there so many more questions? Why did any of it have to go this way?</p>

<p>Someone walks into the bathroom by slamming the swinging door into the trashbin and then proceeds to make even more noise coughing, unzipping, and unleashing a torrent that sounds like a garden hose. I dab the last drop from my eyes, pull off what I hope is the last eyelash dingleberry, and sit quietly, not ready to emerge yet.</p>

<p>When Renaldo asked to telecommute, I told Jenna it was a transparent way of slacking off, an excuse for people to escape the responsibility of interacting face to face with their coworkers. She likes to remind me of this now, on the occasions when I’ve worked from home. But perhaps I can buy a week telecommuting while looking for new jobs. I won’t need to let her know about any of this until I have a new gig. I can’t let her know; things are bad already. It will ruin my chances of repairing all the damage between us. But I could tell her I’m on an assignment where I’ll be far more productive from the comfort of my Byron Kazman chair at home than I will with the distractions of the office. By the time I have to tell the truth, I’ll have something new lined up. I’ll have plenty to keep me looking busy there in the home office. A post-mortem accounting. Past email trails to unravel. Stacks of names and dates on which to perform sort operations. Stitchfiles to be unstitched. Tarballs to excavate. Heroic swings to be made on the mousecord, across clusters of registry keys and hex-code kernel stacks and over swamps of spaghetti code. Hundreds of megs of email to sort and archive. And all of Renaldo’s MP3s to sift through, to assess the extent of his piracy, should I need to document that kind of thing for some reason. For example, if I am subpoenaed to testify against him. Because I’m sure the jury will appreciate the fact that he listened to a band called <em>The Ass-Toe-Nauts</em>, whose album <em>Suckulate the Ass-Toe-Nauts</em> features songs called <em>Double Nipulation</em>, <em>Commando Tiggy Attack</em>, <em>Penile to the Vaginile</em>, and <em>Rape the Fear</em>.</p>

<p>I flip open my Moto again, and page down until the selection bar inverts the name I’m looking for: Ray Powers.</p>

<p>Ray, my good old pledge dad, is a traffic engineer. I saw him, incidentally, at the alumni weekend just weeks ago. Powers is a real trooper, understands how to get what he wants. For years, he’s been in a legal contest with his cell phone company for not allowing him to recover deleted voicemails from his now-deceased wife. By the grace of a court mandate, he’s keeping those voicemails alive, somewhere, on some backup server, and meanwhile his lawyer, a machine in his own right, is churning through legal procedures. “Stoplights are like valves,” he told me. “Think of them as valves. And people are just the fluid mass. Understand, navigation is a process. Be one with the system, like fluid. I’m gonna win this, if I just follow the flow. I’m gonna listen to Angie’s final messages again someday.”</p>

<p>I think our introductory conversation during rush week cemented his paternal role in the minds of the other guys. Twenty-year olds gathered around us on couches, rubbing their palms, excited to let us know why this was the best engineering fraternity on the U of I campus, but Ray and I only talked to each other, mostly about network theory and matrices. You could almost hear the mental snores from the couch-squatters around us. When it came down to it, they would have preferred to discuss how to beat the GPA-killing freshman Calc and Chem curves, or how much harder Mech E was than Electrical E. Or how much harder Electrical E was than Computer E, or how Civil E had the greatest dearth of hot chicks. They weren’t so interested in logical matrices or set theory or routing theory or the notion of life as a dynamic matrix, a notion which Ray taught me right then and there.</p>

<p>Still, even bored to silence, they knew who my pledge-dad would be.</p>

<p>When he answers, I explain the situation. The closure of NDC, the secret auction, the contract I signed with T J. “And that’s just my professional life,” I say. “I can’t even get into the other problems right now.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen, Chad,” he says, “First of all, don’t call Torvin anymore, and don’t take any calls from him. Who is your attorney?”</p>

<p>“I don’t have one.”</p>

<p>“Well, you need one.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I just—I never needed one for anything major.”</p>

<p>“Chipp Gathers is my representation. That’s Chipp with two Ps. I can put you in—”</p>

<p>“Chipp with two Ps?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Did his parents not think one P was good enough?”</p>

<p>“You know, it never occurred to me. Is it weird?”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be a coincidence, let’s put it that way.”</p>

<p>Ray laughs. I like it that he laughs even when he’s not sure what I mean. That’s the way people should be. He goes on:</p>

<p>“Chipp always says, follow the money. He understands the psychopathic tendencies of corporations. Financed his way through Chicago University by short-selling stocks.”</p>

<p>“Wait—Chicago University? You mean University of Chicago?”</p>

<p>“No, not that. Actually, I think it’s Chicago State University. Anyway, that’s not important. He says he used to go to these corporate bashes, just crash them, you know, just to see what kind of money the company really had. You know, if they had caviar and free MacSkirlin in Q1, he held on to his shares and the good feeling that went with them. But if then, say in Q3, they were serving Xtra Light at a cash bar, he unloaded everything. For awhile, he said, with IPOs and tech stocks, this was absolutely foolproof.”</p>

<p>“You’re not really convincing me, Ray.”</p>

<p>“Listen, this is going to be okay. You can’t go it alone though. Chipp knows what he’s doing. He understands the systems that we don’t. Municipal, corporate, federal, economic. Law, Chad. There’s a reason they call it code. It forms one gigantic computer program. To get anywhere with it, you have to pair up with the operational entities. Chipp understands this better than any lawyer, any person I’ve ever known. He feels it. He feels this whole system like it’s part of his own body.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he’s a very sensual guy.”</p>

<p>“I’m serious here,” Ray says. “Here’s what this guy says. He sounds kind of crazy, but he’s really just a totally sane person describing crazy things. He says every relationship in the universe is a contract, a connection between two entities.”</p>

<p>“How many hits of acid was he on when he said that?”</p>

<p>“He’s totally clean now. Anyway, I’m serious here. I came up with my own example. When I walk up to an intersection, I have a contract with the signs and signals at that intersection. And just like any contract, it’s what’s not said that really gets you in trouble. The light is green, and the don’t walk signal is illuminated. I must agree not to walk until the Walk signal is illuminated. That is one contract. Another contract is stated on a sign: Push button to cross street. According to that contract, I can push the button to receive a walk signal. So I push it. I’m signing the contract. Another part of the contract is in those two crosswalk lines. If I get the signal, and I walk, I agree to walk between those lines. I say fine. I don’t have a problem with that. Most people don’t. It’s okay to step a little bit outside the lines. That’s not explicit, but we know it’s okay. A few steps outside a line does not constitute jaywalking. And as long as the walk signal is lit, I am abiding by the contract when I cross the street. The light is green, so at some moment I should receive a walk signal. This is the expectation most people have. If the cars can go through the intersection, I should be able to go through as well, people reason. But if you think about it, sometimes the walk signal can be lit while the light is red. Oftentimes. So it’s natural that sometimes the don’t walk signal will be lit while the light is green. And in fact, you may press the button while the light is green, and the walk signal may never light. You will have to stand through another red light. In that case, the contract is not what you expected. You form new expectations. You now expect that the walk signal will light with the next green light. Because while it’s not what you expected, it also makes sense that your request to cross the street is always a request for the next green light. Red or green, you get to cross on the next green, not the current green. This is more frustrating, but not if you truly understand the contract. And this is where lawyers help. In actuality, your walk light request on this street is a request for the next red light on the cross street. Which is not the way we would think of it, but from the perspective of the system’s designers makes perfect sense. If only two seconds remain on the cross street’s red light, for example, and during those two seconds, a walk signal puts a pedestrian in the way without allowing the pedestrian enough time to cross, then the system has failed. We have cars advancing on a pedestrian. That’s what, viewing the ambulatory public as one corpus, I call Anomalous Corpus Interruptus. It happens a lot, of course, but our job is to minimize it as much as possible. And we’re not approved to use curb gates, yet. Anyway, shut me up already. You always get me rambling about traffic control. The point is this: what most people don’t realize is that the real contract is with the whole system. So the question becomes, simply, what is the big contract? So with NDC, you had several contracts—yours, this T Js, Torvin’s, the company charter and license, etcetera—but what you really need is someone to figure out is just what is the big contract that binds all this with the unknown.”</p>

<p>He falls silent, and for a second there is nothing, not even static on the connection.</p>

<p>“Holy cow,” I say. “I wish you could represent me, but if not, I guess I’ll give this guy a call.”</p>

<p>“He’s a very bright guy. Just trust his guidance, and he’ll get you through it. But it can take time. I’m still working my way through the grid, Chad. It’s been six months, and there’s still no end in sight. It’s like anything, you have to travel fifty feet to get four inches. Court orders are a wonderful thing, when they work for the little guy. I’ve got them at a standstill. “</p>

<p>I knew Angie all the way back when he was dating her during my junior, his senior, year. Her hair was an obviously natural blond. I would say straw or corn except that she considered such terms “downstate” terms and would have laughed at me. She was always quick to point out, to anyone, even if they had been born and raised in the Chicago metro area, like me, that certain terms were more hickish than others. “What are you, from downstate?” she’d ask. Occasionally, people would say that yes, they were from Centralia, or Vandalia, or Morton, or Peoria, or whatever, to which she’d gasp and promptly terminate her conversation with them. But if they weren’t, she would be happy to debate the correct pronunciation of “TV” or the hickishness of using phrases like “that’s roguish, man” or “don’t get salty with me,” or “later days, dude.” She even tried to draw agreeable people like me into these discussions. She loved it. And she was an economics major!</p>

<p>One day last summer, she was coming out of the grocery store at some busy intersection on Elgin road. It was just starting to spit rain, and she was on the phone with Ray. He was asking her if she could run across the way to return a video. She said she was too tired. And anyway she hadn’t watched it yet and maybe she would watch it tonight. He reminded her, nicely, that late fees at this particular store were higher, per day, than rental fees, and it would be better for her to return it and re-rent it than to incur late fees. Besides, Ray hated paying late fees or any other kind of totally avoidable penalty. It went against his whole philosophy of working within systems in order to avoid being punished by them. They argued. She was too tired to out-argue him, and finally she agreed to do it, but not without being mad. She hung up on him.</p>

<p>Now Ray hates it when people hang up without saying goodbye, especially if those people are usually his wife. He threw the phone into the garage wall. Which wasn’t a big deal because it was a nineties cell phone, a Motomoto as a matter of fact, and their high-end phones in the nineties were pretty durable, and you could usually snap things back together and they would work. He knew from experience. The phone shattered into its constituent parts, each of which skittered to a different hiding place under his workbench.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be unusual, on Elgin road, for someone to drive their car from one parking lot to another parking lot across the street. The alternative, for a woman in sensible heels, would be to hoof it, from her car out to the farthest (and worst) row of parking spaces in the grocery store parking lot, then wait at the corner to cross Elgin, then, once across the six lanes, cross the video store lot to the video store drop slot, then reverse her steps all the way back to her car. It would make sense, for most people, just to drive. Angie must have considered it and decided that more traffic would have felt more exhausting than walking. Which is what she decided to do, across the six lanes of Elgin road.</p>

<p>She called Ray back, but since he was still picking up the pieces of his phone, she got his voicemail. He can recite verbatim what she said: “Hi Sweetie. So. Um. Sorry I snapped back there. Been a rough day. I just wanted you to know I’m walking over to the video store right now. I know how much you hate late fees. I’ll ask them if I can re-rent it. Okay. Love you.” She hung up. Then, she crossed Elgin on foot and returned the video.</p>

<p>As she crossed Elgin again, she left another message on his voicemail. Again, he can recite this one too: “Ray, I hope you’re not super mad. I asked to re-rent that video, and they told me I needed to wait in line. There were like ten people in line. It’s that kind of day. Anyway, I couldn’t wait any longer. I’m going back to the car now. I’ll rent it again some other time. I’m not mad at you. I’ll be home in a little bit. Love ya, babe.”</p>

<p>She got back in her car. You can’t get into or out of the grocery store parking lot on Elgin—you have to use the cross street to enter and exit—which is a modern traffic convention common across most Midwestern suburbs. So Angie took a left onto the cross street, crossed to the far right to make a right turn onto Elgin, stopped at the red light and then made the right turn. As she did, a station wagon came skidding toward her, and smashed into her door.</p>

<p>It shook her up, but she was okay. She called Ray again. But his phone was not coming back to life. She left another voicemail. He doesn’t recite that one. It chokes him up. Basically, she told him she was in an accident, but it wasn’t bad, and she was okay. Said she was going to call triple A. Said she loved him again. That’s the part that really chokes Ray up. Those last words.</p>

<p>The driver’s side door was too damaged to open, so she crawled out the other side. Traffic was pretty jammed up because now there was one less lane. An older lady had gotten out of the station wagon. She was a nice lady, Ray said. He met her. She and Angie had exchanged insurance information. Then they both stood on the corner by the grocery store, waiting.</p>

<p>An ambulance came sirening down Elgin, then careening into the traffic snarl, swerving around the jam-up by driving up on the sidewalk where Angie and the other woman stood. The other woman stepped back to avoid being hit, but at the same moment, Angie, who was standing behind the signal pole and invisible to the driver, stepped forward to see better. The headlight and bumper clipped her and she went down underneath the wheels. It took just an instant, the crossing of those paths. The other woman screamed bloody murder and so did everyone else who saw it happen. By the time the EMTs exited the vehicle and got to Angie, she was already dead. She was doomed by the very vehicle that came to save her, when in fact, she didn’t need to be saved at all.</p>

<p>He told me this at the alumni tailgate party just this year, as we sat stuffing sausage into our faces. The leaves had turned, faint variations on the orange in the fan attire. It couldn’t have been more than five months since the accident. But Ray was serene. He was with a redhead, an unnerving woman. She stood a full head higher than me and had truly red hair. Not the flat orange color of the shirts and hats all around us, but an incandescent scarlet. And bone-white skin. Ray said she was just a coworker, and she smiled a freckle-lipped smile when he said it, wiped mustard from her chin, and took another lunge at her brat.</p>

<p>You had to keep going, he explained, later. He couldn’t allow himself to be alone.</p>

<p>Ray is a wonderful pledge dad. He knows the value of control. Knows that life is amorphous. Knows that one must impose upon it, or be imposed upon.</p>

<p>But still, screw that Chip with two Ps. There’s no way I can call him.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Back at our post at the bar, my seat has been taken by a rat-faced guy in a puffy jacket, sipping on a too-dark beer and eyeing me suspiciously.</p>

<p>“My seat,” I say.</p>

<p>He looks surprised.</p>

<p>“You’re sitting in it. Get up.”</p>

<p>He nods, then takes a long slow sip of his beer while continuing his nodding. He’s barely swallowed it all before he apologizes. But he doesn’t get up right away. He drinks the rest of the beer, pushes away the glass and stands up. “Hey brah,” he says. “Looked empty. Sorry.” He slinks away as I ease back into my seat.</p>

<p>Renaldo is now dorking out with some ironically dressed beardcat from Colorado and his trashy looking dreadlocked girlfriend. They’re all talking about how awesome skateboarding in Buenos Aires is.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” I say, leaning in, “While high on club drugs, right?”</p>

<p>The dreadlock girl makes a face and tries not to look at me.</p>

<p>Renaldo says “just ignore him.”</p>

<p>I try to get him to stop talking to them, but he seems not to hear. I tap his shoulder. “Rendaldo,” I say. “Hey smokestack.”</p>

<p>Tapping him on the shoulder doesn’t seem to cut it, so I tug lightly on his pony tail, saying “Ding Dong,” and that gets him whipping around. I draw back, thinking he might lash out. I won’t call it a flinch, but it’s pretty close.</p>

<p>“You need to get lost now, Chad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really?” I say, “As if I don’t have a right to be here too?”</p>

<p>Renaldo, for the first time ever, is really simmering. I’ve got him, finally, really mad, and about to lose it. His face is all scrunched in different directions. His anger is making me angrier, so I add, “Why don’t <em>you</em> get lost, you <em>fucking loon.</em>”</p>

<p>He has these lines on his forehead I’ve never noticed before. They’ve come out in bas-relief. He looks like one of those maps of the ocean floor all of a sudden.</p>

<p>“Nice,” I say. “Tan much?”</p>

<p>“I’m not a violent person,” he says, “But right now I’d like to smash your smarmy Republican fucking face in.”</p>

<p>“Actually,” I say, “I consider myself an independent. It’s just never made sense to vote Democrat, and I support the party that stands for sheer naked individualism. I do give generous donations to the Republican party, just to offset the effects of people like—”</p>

<p>“Shut up Chad. Just shut the fuck up.”</p>

<p>“Socialists like you wouldn’t understand independent thought anyway.”</p>

<p>Now the little beardcat steps around Renaldo, adjusting his baseball hat with the ironic agri-business logo on it. He’s smirking a bit, like he’s got something to say that’s really important. It turns out to begin with “Hey man” and then ramble a bit, but what becomes coherent is “I mean, man, I feel like the whole Republican thing is just a big excuse to be a real asshole about everything. It’s like institutionalized asshole-ism. It’s like people basically decide that they wanna be assholes and then realize there’s a whole political movement that seems to make that okay.”</p>

<p>“You know what they say,” I tell him. “Better to be an asshole than a buttwipe. Like you.”</p>

<p>His eyebrows scrunch up and his face darkens. But instead of saying anything else, he shrinks back, lurking next to his natty headed girlfriend who’s making a poop face about the whole exchange.</p>

<p>Renaldo is gripping his beer glass, staring up at some non-specific place in the bar mirror. I start poking his shoulder, making a soft, high pitched, fake laughter sound, the kind you might imagine is made by a tittering Japanese school girl. I figure he should know this sound, since he studied Asians in school.</p>

<p>“Naldo-san,” I say. “Naldo-san, what you think? Tee hee!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I ever did to you,” Renaldo says, still staring into space.</p>

<p>I stop tittering and poking. “Really,” I say. “I could list all the things you did. Your behavior is completely inane. You’re an attention whore. Even worse, you’re a total poser. You smell bad most of the time. And you don’t deserve any of the unearned admiration you get. And yet you call me a dick. You tell people everything is my fault. You want to see me take the fall. To eat it. To suffer for my mistakes. You revel in that idea.”</p>

<p>He looks at me, and now he just looks tired. “I get it,” he says. “You need attention. You want people to like you. You’re so intent on it that you’ll cut down everyone because you think that’s the only way to level the field. I’ve known people like you before. The problem is, you’re a nobody. You’re actually, when it comes down to it, worthless. You contribute nothing to the world but misery, mockery and bad ideas. You perpetuate the worst aspects of humanity. You make Americans look bad, and you embarrass yourself over and over trying to show everyone what you are, which is nothing at all. You are really a tiny, tiny ant of a man, Chad. I think you even know that yourself, somewhere inside. But no matter how hard you try, you’re ultimately going to fail at everything, and be miserable your whole life, and just become more and more pathetically self-deceiving.”</p>

<p>The agri-tard and his natty lady turn and disappear into the crowd. I watch them the whole time. I refuse to look at Renaldo anymore.</p>

<p>“You’re actually, deep down, a colossal loser, and most everyone who knows you, even superficially, can see that. I never liked you from day one, never liked working with you, never thought any good could come out of your existence on this planet. For me, you’re a constant repugnant reminder of the lowest common denominator, something we should all aspire to avoid becoming.”</p>

<p>As he speaks, some kind of impromptu drum solo winds down, and the bartender delivers a shot of something pitch black in front of Renaldo.</p>

<p>I stare at at the lines around the corners of his mouth, at the crows feet on his eyes.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” I say. “You just don’t understand me, that’s all. And you don’t want to understand guys like me. You and everyone else. That’s your problem.”</p>

<p>My food comes, but I’ve lost my appetite, and I finish less than half of the veal and none of the spaetzle, which seems soggy. I get my tainted beer replaced and suckle a new one, not really wanting it, feel it feeding into the dull signal of a burgeoning headache. The place has quickly gotten too noisy and smoky. Already I’m thinking ahead to the moment when I locate my Beamer in its cozy corner of the parking garage.</p>

<p>Renaldo doesn’t stay too long after that, and we don’t say much. He staggers away without even waving at me, wearing his frontpack, weaving his way through the packed bar area, then along the tile pathway to the front entrance.</p>

<p>After awhile longer, when the throbbing in my temples has reached an unbearable tautness, I put on my coat, take two of the three dollars sitting by my glass, and leave.</p>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<h3>AN END OF THE WORLD PARTY</h3>

<p class="break"><br/></p><br/><h5>•••</h5>

<p>Outside, the wind is whipping, making me wish I had a scarf or a coat, and the rain has turned to snow that stings my cheeks and turns to mist within inches of the pavement. It tinges everything around me with amber and pink and, while I’m not one to ponder the effect of precipitation on my mood, as I walk to the parking garage, following the sidewalk in the stinging mist, seeing the streetlights diffused and blushing in it, I can’t help but be reminded of my wife’s beauty: that pinkness, that amber, the white and silver. I can’t wait to see her. I’ll tell her everything. Really, everything, because I know she’ll understand. I’ll explain everything, starting with the pink slips. And she’ll listen, she’ll understand. As bad as things have gone, there’s still time to make them better.</p>

<p>We last had sex just a month and ten days ago. It’s difficult now that our Ethan is here. He sleeps best when Wagner is playing at a moderate volume in the living room. It’s a coincidence, I suppose, or perhaps an association, but my wife’s favorite Wagner piece, Tristan and Isolde, is also the piece that makes me incredibly horny. Sundays do not normally make her feel sexy, but her Sunday best is what excites me most. I spend most of my time in church scootching on the pew and plucking my slacks to readjust the wood I get. It doesn’t help to be surrounded by other petite, well-accessorized, tantalizingly perfumed women (we have a young congregation), and while my mind does wander, it always comes back to Jenna, lilac-scented and prim on the pew. By the time we get back from the Red Barn Pancake House on York Road, I am ready to ravish her like I did on that first night we met.</p>

<p>Jenna grew up in a family that made her play flute far longer than she wanted, and the only music allowed in the house was classical. Wagner has always been her favorite. Because my wife played Wagner for so many years—in college, Wagner was the soundtrack to studying, sleeping, talking and making love—and because she didn’t get tired of it afterwards, either, I came to love Wagner too. I especially loved Tristan and Isolde, but only a certain version of it with a beautiful riffing piano.</p>

<p>Well, Wagner was playing at around nine o’clock that night, but Jenna had put on a baggy sweatsuit the color of Eclat-Stretto’s strawberry ice cream, and she’d taken off her earrings, her pendant necklace, and all of her rings (including the wedding band, which I don’t like her to do, as long as we’re still married, but she insists that it pinches her finger). She had washed her makeup off. She’d also been lying down for awhile, flattening one side of her hair. Just that morning it had looked perfect, stiff with hairspray that revealed the dark roots. Her hair has gotten shorter every year since college, to the point that now it doesn’t cover her neck at all, and I actually have come to prefer this. I like to see my wife’s neck and be able to touch it, especially when she’s giving me oral sex. She got very good at it during the first pregnancy. Neither one of us felt it would be appropriate to have regular sex while she was carrying Ethan, and we figured oral sex was okay as long as she didn’t swallow. Somehow it was during that time that the Wagner became the thing we played. I usually sat on the ottoman, and after taking off everything but her jewelry, she would kneel on the carpet in front of me. It was the kind of kneeling they taught her to do in breathing classes but it reminded me also of Catholics. Not as I knew them but as they were in my imagination or in certain old paintings I’ve seen. Loosely robed women and what-have-you. Of course there was nothing truly pious about it, but I appreciated the dignity of it. It seemed somehow sophisticated and adult, the way the Catholic religion of Jenna’s parents seemed more sophisticated and mature than my own family’s cut-and-dried modern Presbyterianism.</p>

<p>Neither one of us had really felt like adults until that first pregnancy. The fact that she put on some weight and her belly became a taut moon beneath her jutting nipples never bothered me. In fact, it was a real joy. Jenna has a very beautiful neck, long and slightly bony. I like her boniness quite a bit and there is nothing that excites me more than the hollow areas between her collarbones and the muscles of her neck while she’s delivering oral sex.</p>

<p>That evening I was unable to stop thinking about a certain blonde mother of two who at church sat with her husband and two teenage daughters in the pew in front of us. Each time we stood up to read psalms there was a clear shot of the triangular thongline through her flowerprint dress and a crease that delineated enough of the crack of her bottom to burn a lasting impression on my brain.</p>

<p>We still go to the Presbyterian church. The one that Mrs. Bayer-Whyte goes to. No eating flesh or drinking blood there, that’s for sure, although there are occasions on which my wife insists we go do that too. But our regular church is strictly some singing and praying and chit-chatting with sugar cookies and coffee. Everyone is nice, and at church, you can like anyone. Catholic or Presbyterian doesn’t matter. What counts most is that everyone shares the same ritual. Ritual is important. Ask Mrs. Bayer-Whyte. She’s out there ritually exhausting her well-toned body right now. She’s training herself. Training that sweet bod. Whipping it into a lather. Or that sweet bod is training her. Keeping her in line.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, it’s an important ritual. A ritual allows people to believe in higher authority. And a higher authority is what everyone needs to believe in. Belief can be engineered like anything else. People do things because they believe in them, but they believe in them because they do them. There’s nothing wrong with that. People need that. They need a semblance of control.</p>

<p>Semblance means rigmarole. Humanity needs that. We all do.</p>

<p>The Wagner was already playing at just the right volume. At Jenna’s request I had gotten a really nice multi-room surround-sound system put in after we bought the house, with hidden Saurius speakers and a fortune in Brio cabling, and it sounded excellent, simply excellent. There was a separate volume control for the speakers in Ethan’s room, and he had fallen into a rare deep sleep behind a mostly closed door. The baby monitor showed a solid green LED. Jenna was in the strawberry ice cream outfit, her bedhead somewhat fixed but still not looking exactly hot, and she was clipping coupons at the dining room table, which due to the size and openness of our house was fairly far away from where I sat in my favorite easy chair. Behind her the picture window was dark except for a few twinkling lights from other houses in the neighborhood. I had been enjoying a glass of Xtra Light, which I now finished quickly, setting the empty glass back down on the stand. I got up and walked across the TV room and up the one carpeted step into the living room, and across that and through the archway into the dining room, where I put my hands on Jenna’s bony shoulders and asked her if she felt like dressing up in something for some casual business. I fully expected her to push my hands away one at a time and shake her head, and that would be that. If she did that I would take one of my Chatte Exposés or the new Mary Ann Rothmoor catalog into the downstairs bathroom and do some casual business of my own. But instead she tilted her head far back and looked up at me, her lips parted and her eyes glistening. Our flame, our particular passion, the magnetism that originally drew us together, was still there. I could see raised ridges on her throat and, despite her frumpy outfit, I had a firm sense things were going as well as I wanted.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pretend you’re getting ready to go to work at Arlensin?” I said, and she eyed me steadily as she stood up. “Like the good old days.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be patient,” she said. “It may take me awhile.” And she shuffled down the hall toward our bedroom.</p>

<p>I went back to the armchair to wait.</p>

<p>I was not disappointed. She came from the hall purposefully, like she was entering a boardroom, wearing a sleeveless silk blouse and a gray linen skirt. She had on dark stockings (the kind I knew would be suspended with garters), black heels that were higher than the ones she actually would have worn to work (which suited me just fine), and her hair had been teased with a slightly-more-sluttish abandon than she would have dared at Arlensin. Her makeup was thick enough that I could see grains of powder in it. It was not garish. It simply set off her features and did not distort them or add new ones. Her lips were made full with a natural-colored lipstick—but not too full. What got me very excited, as she drew the blinds on all the windows and finally came over to me, were the jewelry, naturally, and the watch and the purse: the watch was an Aimee Moss that cost $340 at Macy’s in Watertower Place, and the purse was a $250 Jane Trow purse made of black leather and shaped like a box of that fancy Swiss chocolate they sell at O’Hare. The purse had offended me once—not just for being a gross ripoff, but because I’d bought her a perfect imitation for Christmas that looked every bit like this one at a fraction of the cost, and the following spring she went ahead and bought herself the real thing anyway. Now I was glad she had. I especially liked the way the watch fit loosely on her wrist, the way its silvery-thin, delicate links resting against her skin seemed too rough and heavy for the even finer delicacy of her hand. I liked its little compact rectangle with the platinum roman numerals crowded around the invisible central pin. It made me proud of her. At the same time it made me want to ravish her. I said a small prayer, right then, that Ethan would not wake up to interrupt this possibility. Luck was on my side: he had never yet woken up during Wagner. The music was on my side. It was at that part in Isolde where the rills of piano swell up and fill your chest like cascading water and the combination of that and my well-dressed, accessorized Jenna leaning over me to give me a wild scent of perfume and an oily, lipsticky kiss made me want to do it right there in my leather easy chair. She said hotly in my ear that she hadn’t been able to fit into a size two since she quit Arlensin. Then she hiked her skirt up to give me a view of the garters and her little pink tulip which she had recently begun waxing every two weeks. She slid both her knees up carefully to straddle me and like a little girl held her purse up close to her face, hunting through it until she found and pulled out a Hourix Latex Extra.</p>

<p>Her brief girlishness and the sight of that utilitarian package coming from that sleek expensive purse made her seem hookerish for a moment, but I was determined not to let this bother me. Since we started having real vaginal-style sex and not just oral sex as we did during her pregnancy with Ethan, she had always insisted on condoms. For various reasons, she refuses to go on the pill, the main one being she says it makes her fat. The thing for me to do was forget about the condom so it couldn’t ruin the mood, so I quickly tore the package open and set it on the arm of the chair. When the time came, I had her stand up in front of me and ease herself back, holding her skirt bunched around her hips.</p>

<p>“Sit on Grandpa’s lap,” I said.</p>

<p>She liked the perverted sound of that, although she would never admit to it. I told her I wanted to start out without the condom and she said no. I had to beg her. “No,” she said, “We don’t want another mistake, not now.”</p>

<p>I promised it would only be for a minute. “Two seconds,” she said. I asked for four. The deleterious effect of condoms was even worse since she’d had Ethan. She was considering surgery to make things down there tighter again, because the last few attempts we’d made were pretty bad. If I thought about the issue too much, sex wouldn’t even seem worthwhile. I knew this. I needed to accept it and not think about it. I knew there were other methods but she didn’t like any of them. So it was better not to what if. She agreed to four seconds. I begged for five or six, but, “Only four,” she said. “Four or none.” So I enjoyed four seconds of that indescribable sensation of feeling the slick hot curvature and ridges of the inside of her and she must have been one-one-thousand-ing the whole time because in exactly four seconds she lifted herself off me and waited, bent forward with her arms bunched in her lap so all I could see of her was her bare rear end.</p>

<p>“Is it on yet?”</p>

<p>“Wait a second,” I said. My hand was groping the arm of the chair. It was probably on the floor or maybe it had slid somewhere inside the chair but in any case by the time I found it the mood would be ruined and the business end of me would be limp. So I said, “Yeah,” and guided her back onto me. “Are you sure it’s on right?” she asked, as she moved herself over me. “Yeah,” I said, stiffening and reaching one hand down between the cushion of the chair and the armrest, reaching down to the sturdy fabric stretched over metal bars beneath the cushion, wedging my fingers in, tapping them on that taut surface as far in either direction as I could. I leaned forward, so my chest pressed into her back. She was moving faster now, and enjoying herself, and I was caring less whether I ever found the thing but even so I leaned sideways, over the armrest, scanned the carpet’s tight pile, near the bottom edge of the chair, looking for a corner of foil. Must have fallen underneath the edge or could have ended up there by falling all the way through the insides of the chair. But I didn’t see it. Jenna had her hands on my knees now, to brace herself, and my one hand was gripping her hipbone, quickening her up and down motion, while with the other hand I reached as far as I could, leaning my body into the armrest and extending my fingers far enough to feel the surface of carpet. I worked them under the chair, probing and sliding them forward and back, patting and tapping for an edge of foil, but I found nothing. Jenna was making small mewling noises now. Her purse was my next objective. A little farther from the chair than I could probably reach, but I tried, leaning to the other side, over the armrest, pressing my ribs so hard I felt wood beneath the plush. My fingers flailed for a moment, stretching, then hooked a strap and pulled the purse closer. Jenna was saying the word shit in a dainty way and whispering about how good it felt. I ran my free hand up her blouse and poked fingers under the edge of her bra to pinch her nipple while my other hand brought the purse up into my lap. It was still unzipped and I searched through it, pausing for a second to exhale loudly from holy sensations.</p>

<p>There were no condoms in it. I was feeling too good to be frustrated: I threw the purse aside and running my other hand up her blouse pulled her back against me so I could feel her shoulderblades on my chest and her head against my neck and holding her against me I rolled her onto the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>A foot on the ground, a knee in the cushion and, like a biological metronome, I measured out my last refrains. It was wonderful, and we both knew it.</p>

<p>After my vigor had completely drained away, I lay on top of her, gasping for air and trying to figure out what I was going to tell her.</p>

<p>Ethan woke up. I heard his crescendoing squall before she did. She was preoccupied with the wetness down there, asking me to check the condom, see if it looked okay. Then she heard it too, and asked me to get up, to get off her, please. I did, and watched her stand, her skirt still bunched around her hips, her fingers feeling around between her legs.</p>

<p>“Did it come off?” she asked me, her eyes slowly growing wide.</p>

<p>I said nothing. I tried my best to look as if I was about to reassure her. This involved letting my mouth hang open like I was about to speak, narrowing my eyes to convey a sense of calm and just the hint of a smile, offering a hand that could easily become a comforting squeeze on the shoulder and keeping the other hand closed as if concealing the used condom. But she was looking at me as if I’d slapped her. Her eyes had the old look in them again, the look I’d been seeing all year. They were stony and cold. I imagined the reflections on their pupils, two images of Myrianna instead of me. She said, “I have to see what he wants.” Later, I got in the Beamer, and drove; I drove for a pretty long time.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>The Beamer. It takes me some wandering up and down ramps to remember where I parked it. Then I spot it, across soft pools of light, in a corner of the garage away from the stairwells and elevators, its fancy rear end peeking from the shadow. The tail-lights wink at me when I unlock it with the remote. I come up alongside the shining white flank and reach for the door handle.</p>

<p>It’s just as I touch the handle that something makes me pause, some noise maybe, or a shadow. Instead of just opening the door, I freeze. And then I see it. Near the front bumper, something, or someone, stands up from the shadows. Ski mask. Camouflage vest over black hooded sweatshirt.</p>

<p>I feel a tight little smile work its way onto my face, the taut smirk of someone who has walked into the wrong room at a party. Beneath the ski mask I can see dark shining eyes and a goatee. This is not good.</p>

<p>But the figure has a familiar, desperate, slouchy build. Ah, I think. Now I understand: it’s a joke. The outfit is too cartoon mugger to be real. It’s a leftover Halloween costume. This is flattering. I’m well-liked enough to deserve a good-natured prank. After all my agonizing this afternoon over what people thought of me at NDC, a friend decides to give me a little scare, in the spirit of fraternity. I laugh, but disappointingly—a womanly titter.</p>

<p>I say: “Renaldo?”</p>

<p>The figure keeps moving on me, slowly stepping toward me with something in his hand. A voice certainly not Renaldo’s says: “Give us the keys.”</p>

<p>Now I pull the door open, already visualizing in my head the sequence of events to be executed like lines of code, as fast as my body can process them: get in lock doors start it pull out. But as I’m squeezing in behind the door, he shoves its frame against me, pinning me like a walnut in a nutcracker. His hand grabs my face and pushes it to one side. His other hand holds an object toward me, but I can’t see it because of the way my face is being pushed. He tells me to drop the keys on the seat, and then he demands my wallet, which I hand over, and even though he removes his hand to receive it, I keep my head turned up and away, thinking that to stay frozen is the safest thing to do, especially if the thing he has there is a gun. Then he’s asking me something I at first don’t understand. It sounds like he wants to know if I have any parking tickets. “No,” I say, “I never get parking tickets and if I do I pay them right away.”</p>

<p>“Do you have the bloody ticket,” he says, “So I can drive this car out of the garage.”</p>

<p>“You’re taking the car?”</p>

<p>“Fuck yeah,” he says. “Is the ticket in the car or do you have the ticket on your body?”</p>

<p>“Don’t take the car. Please, you really don’t want it.”</p>

<p>He tells me to shut the hell up. I move my head and look down my nose to see what the object he’s holding is and I’m surprised to see not a gun but a puny little carrot peeler!</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re gonna to do with that thing?”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” he says.</p>

<p>“Are you going to peel me?”</p>

<p>“Give me the ticket,” he says, and without waiting, he grabs me with his free hand and swings me 180 degrees into the Massat parked next to us. The alarm starts going off. It’s one of those randomizing siren alarms. He starts punching me repeatedly in the gut. Each punch makes a sound like a dodgeball impact. No, he’s not punching me, he’s puncturing me—with that thing. Shadows from the Massat’s flashing lights are jumping around on the surfaces and so are the sounds of the shrill alarm. Each time he throws me against the car, there’s a horrible clunk like a cantaloupe dropped in a kitchen sink, and new pain. Multiple stitches draw tighter when I try to straighten up, and when he lets go, I slump forward, trying to fold my head into my left armpit, as if falling down a staircase, the safe way. The Massat siren is doing the laser battle sound: Tchew, Tchew, Tchew! I hit concrete and curl myself around the Massat’s front tire, conjuring a terrifying image of what Ray’s poor wife Angie must have looked like. Behind me, I recognize the dignified throat-clearing of my Beamer being started, though I’ve never heard it from this particular position. I can feel air hitting the back of my head when it starts. The chill of the concrete seeps into my shoulder as something slicks out past my fingers and razor blades skate around inside my belly and I remain as motionless as possible. The Massat siren alarm is doing the English police car sound now—or is it an ambulance sound?</p>

<p>The parking garage ticket is sitting on the Beamer’s dash, the first place he’ll look. I listen to it pulling out, hear even beneath the shrill siren the transmission shuffle deftly from reverse to drive. I let out a groan that I hope someone will hear, but the sound of my voice blends perfectly with the reverberating frequencies of that fine German motor as it carries itself away.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Something like the smell of moist feet comes wafting across my face. I’m drowsy. My eyelids drop shut and I think, very consciously, that I am not going to let myself die, because this kind of smell, which I’m sure is being produced by my own brain and not something I’m actually sensing, must be a sure sign that one has reached the end.</p>

<p>It’s a Saturday, and my house is full of wintry light. Jenna is wearing some kind of shiny gold sleeveless blouse with giant lotus blossoms all over it, cut low, very low, to reveal her modest but inviting cleavage. And no bra? She breezes past me, heavily perfumed, retrieves her phone from the counter, opens a cabinet and takes out two granola bars, three QuickSeal baggies, some napkins and a small candle. None of that seems odd, but I have to ask what the candle is for.</p>

<p>She whisks past me again. I’ve never seen those pants before. Some kind of fake leather, brown, not skin tight but tight enough to give ample description of her buttocks. And narrow heeled black boots, higher than she likes to wear. This isn’t right. It just isn’t right. Where did the sensible flats go? What happened to the classy skirt? The nude hose? This outfit I’ve never seen before. Did Myrianna &#8230; Parking garages are dangerous places. Park near the exits, in the light, or find another garage. Even if you have to pay more. Even if you don’t resist. You should resist. No, you shouldn’t. Even if you allow them to steal things. And stealing is wrong. I’m explaining to a group of developers how zombie networks work. Legions of virus-infected home computers, where the automatons lie dormant, awaiting a signal from a master process. Meanwhile the virus continues to spread, advancing the ranks of the stealth army. Such a network could accomplish anything, if vast enough and swift enough in its action. Shock and awe. One single coordinated attack, if massive enough, could tip political scales, change market outcomes, decimate banking systems, throw governments into chaos, set the stage for anything at all. As long as the virus can stay well hidden for as long as it needs to, while the army multiplies, and as long as it can hide while the critical strikes are taking place. I’m explaining all this in a conference room much like the one we had the extended hashcrypting session in, but my audience is not NDC. It’s a room full of strange faces. It’s every face I’ve ever seen in my life. I keep scanning the room and the faces keep changing. There are dead pixels in the cinder block walls and green LED light escapes from beneath its surface. I describe a shark attack, diagram it on the whiteboard. I draw the path of the Titanic in a dashed line. On the board I write: FALLUJA. Each letter, I’m thinking, is a path. A separate path. And then I draw a line across the tops of the letters, and another line across the bottoms, and turn to my audience. The faces are now the faces of the furtive fellows from Wunder Bar. “Complete circuit,” I say. They smile, and green light escapes from between their teeth. And none of this is strange, really. Not to me. Not right now. I like Renaldo. Despite everything else, I only want to be his friend. Maybe I will visit California. Surely there are suburbs unthreatened by landslides or forest fires or wayward teens from Skokie. Not everyone with a baseball hat plays baseball.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I’m on a bus. Of all things. I haven’t ridden one since college. And Ethan is with me, sleeping in my lap, and his stroller is here too, his own little bus, with its own climate control and dual axle speed brakes. We are cruising along the little downstate town of my Alma Mater, on the north side. It is January, and the parkways are strewn with dirty bundles of ice. Every other streetlight is broken. In the yellow pools of the unbroken ones, dormant weeds are swirled around the posts, flattened by vanished snowdrifts. There is a wheel-less bicycle. A Fat Sass cup ringed with silt. A Mofitos bag torn to shreds and faded pink. But on the bus, there’s comfort. Here, for example, things make sense. The rules are clear. No standees permitted. Capacity: [sensible limit]. No eating, drinking, or smoking. Pictures of food, a cigarette and a boom box, with a line through each of them. The rules make sense. The arrangement of bodies is fixed by the arrangement of seats. It’s neat, really neat. People get arranged. It just happens. The minute they decide to take part in the public transport system, they allow themselves to be arranged, and carried along prefixed pathways, stops, times, velocities, all perfectly synced with another municipal wonder, the traffic light system.</p>

<p>In which a red light, gleaming in the gloom, stops the bus, at some anonymous intersection. A stunned-looking grad student type—backpack, thick glasses, books under one arm—waiting to cross. The lights of a fast food place. A gas station, and farther toward campus, parked cars and a pizza place reputed to put LSD in the sauce.</p>

<p>We roll past neon bars. A group of orange coats walking with fast food bags and blankets in their arms. A sort of aquarium of pizza-eaters. The bus is headed for Duff Hall.</p>

<p>Duff Hall is a recreation building, a gym surrounded by hallways, with locker and weight rooms in the basement. It’s where the Lady Cagers play. In my college days, I would sometimes cut through the basement. Once, peeking through a door that wasn’t supposed to be open, I saw one positively Amazonian black girl in a towel. And she saw me, but not before she had let the towel begin its long slide to the floor. I stopped looking at the towel. Gloriously naked, she let out a shrill, high-pitched squeal, followed by a shrieking announcement of the exact nature of my race and gender and presence just outside the doorway. That was the last time I cut through Duff Hall.</p>

<p>A panel is underway. The place is packed. There are no chairs set up for the audience. The bleachers are extended to the edge of the court, and a scatter of people sit in them, but most are packed onto the court, on foot. It’s an audience of mostly women, very sensitive-looking women. A lot of sandals and long dresses. Overall, they fill almost all of the available floor space. There’s a bandstand set up at the far end, and a banner across the back wall says “Lady Power, Go Cagers!” with a logo, the Lady Cagers mascot, a cartoon Indian head dress, with a tiny woman’s body attached to it, dribbling a basketball, on a giant letter U. Another banner, on the bandstand itself, is smaller, and reads, in subdued block letters: WELCOME TO THE PANEL, followed by a list of names. The seated panelists all have bottles of spring water before them, and mikes, and notebooks, but one is standing up, and I recognize her. She’s standing there with an overhead projector just behind her projecting an empty white square.</p>

<p>The panel, despite the empty white square, seems to be underway. The women in the crowd are nodding their heads. I enter the throng, moving slowly, pushing Ethan in front of me. There are no other strollers. Only women, unpregnant and childless, nodding their heads. Nodding, with flushed cheeks, glistening eyes, a breathless anticipation of nothing. The pushing of Ethan in front of me appears to annoy them all. They all seem aware of it, somehow. I try putting myself in front of the stroller, backward-walking, thrusting my butt out between bodies like the hull of a massive freighter breaking the dun waters of Lake Michigan, getting countless breasts rubbed against my upper arms. I slide my groinal area past large rear ends, barely touching them. I tap shoulders, whisper in ears “Excuse me. Trying to find my wife. Sorry. Thanks.”</p>

<p>What is it they say about a mother’s homing instinct for the pule of her child? Does anyone say anything about that? If Ethan would just cry, Jenna might come to us. But Ethan, rosy-cheeked, with a bottle sloshing at his side, sleeps through all of this.</p>

<p>“This is a thought party,” MJ-L says. Now that I’m closer, I can see what looks to be a cluster of dots resolving from the white void behind her.</p>

<p>Then I spot Jenna. Or I think it’s Jenna. Myrianna’s not with her. I scan surrounding heads but Myrianna’s not anywhere.</p>

<p>“So think about this,” MJ-L says. “We make sixteen thousand an hour. Think about that party. Sixteen thousand new alignment-concentrators PER HOUR. And an hour, remember, is more miniscule than an epoch-instant. Way more miniscule! We have sixteen-G monads being programmed and programming themselves, to conform, to concentratize, in the grouping-instinct sense and NOT the mind-glass method, on a problematic distribution map. Think about that! I don’t have to tell you there’s a pretty ominous scatter-algorithm at work there. Yeah, there is! It’s pretty dotty, if you put your own mind-glass to it! A lot of tools, ready to multiply—one, two, three times—in the next epoch-instant! Think about that party. Party of SIXTEEN-THOUSAND, your table is ready? That’s some party! That’s an end-of-the-world party, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>There are a few YESes from the front, but Mona’s not satisfied.</p>

<p>“I’m asking our audience,”—over-reverbed and on her feet, dragging the mike cord—”Hey! I can’t hear you, power-people! I asked a question &#8230; I said THAT’S AN END OF THE WORLD PARTY, IS IT NOT?”</p>

<p>“YES!” the audience shouts, so unitingly loud that I almost fall into the stroller. </p>

<p>“OUR END-OF-THE-WORLD PARTY WILL BE DIFFERENT. OUR END OF THE WORLD PARTY HAS TO BE DIFFERENT, DOESN’T IT?”</p>

<p>“YES!”</p>

<p>“WHO DO WE INVITE TO OUR END-OF-THE-WORLD PARTY?”</p>

<p>On every side of me now, I hear: “JEANS, NOT GENES!!”</p>

<p>The sea of heads around me erupts with applause, individuals exploding upward like Beluga whales breaching the foam and chattering in mid-air. The woman I spotted is not Jenna. Fists are pumped at the air. High fives happen. Whistling sounds are made. The male members of the panel look intensely uncomfortable. One guy is fidgeting so much with a pencil he almost up-ends his water bottle. A military-dressed man can’t seem to loosen his collar enough. Another is just shaking his head, slowly, while he rubs his thumb against his temple.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m following my own instinct now, like the instinct that would guide Jenna to Ethan. Or maybe I’m following along in the wake of their bond. It’s harder than ever to push through, with everyone apparently worked into a lather by Mona’s nonsensical screed. I’m buffeted by shoulders, butts, hips and wildly clapping hands, assaulted by shrieking in my ears. This is clapping gone wild. A well-placed fist just narrowly misses my nose, and I have to wonder how deliberate it was. A single clap here could easily become a backhand, on purpose.</p>

<p>The clapping has died down. Mona is saying something else now, in a calm voice. The beginning of a new tirade, undoubtedly. There. That might be her. It’s a woman who’s on tiptoe, saying something in the ear of the man next to her. Her hand is mostly covering her face. It looks, yes, does look like her. But who’s he? That’s Jenna. It’s her! A man standing too close to her puts his hand on her back. On the small of her back. Where it curves in the most, where through that thin, very sensible Mary Jane Reynolds blouse, he can feel the heat of the dimples where her spine meets her rear end. He can definitely feel that heat. I know because I’ve done it, through that same blouse. I like that part of her back, and he’s not allowed to touch it. He’s certainly not allowed to rub, like he is now, a gentle, up and down rubbing, with only his index and middle fingers, stroking through that excessively thin synthetic. What we have, it seems, is a frotteur. A lonely misfit professor with an addition to calculated body friction. Undoubtedly he induced a conversation and now he’s taking advantage of it to satisfy his perverse little fetish. And she doesn’t know how to react. It’s shock, that’s why it’s taking her so long. She’s going to move away, or confront him about it, or maybe slap him across his depraved face. Someone blocks the view for a moment.</p>

<p>Mona Joules-LeFarb is talking, talking, talking. Jenna sways, almost nudges toward the perv, then does nudge, against his arm, as if admitting it’s there. Someone steps into the view again, then out. She’s taken a sideways step of maybe an inch, toward him, doing nothing to discourage his urge. He continues his rubbing. Someone’s obnoxious woven purse blocks my view of his hand. I try to reposition. Maybe his touch is so light she doesn’t realize it’s him. Maybe she thinks it’s someone’s poodle nuzzling her from a knapsack. She’s turned slightly toward him, as if submitting to the arm, but she stops just short of having her breast poodle his side. Then she moves back. Thank heavens. It could have been accidental. It probably was. I shouldn’t jump to conclusions here. It was either accidental or &#8230; something else. I mean, the place is packed. There’s bound to be some jostling and adjustments of footing. There could have been someone squeezing past her on the other side, someone I couldn’t see, like a little crippled woman in a wheelchair. Of course, she would step aside for someone like that. Even if it meant getting an inch closer to a genuine frotteur. She was being kind. Kind Jenna, stepping aside for the disabled.</p>

<p>“Thought is behavior,” MJ-L says, concluding some lengthy commentary in response to one of the other panelists. She repeats it one more time—”Thought is behavior”—and the crowd, for some reason, goes wild again. Women are high-fiving. Older women pump their fists. A pair of breasts about the size of hackey-sacks bounces up and down right next to me. Teenage girls make a digging motion with their pinkies and hop up and down with happy anger. Bandanas are twirled in the air. Mona waits patiently, repeats the pop phrase one more time with a smile. There’s a mindless repeat of excess jubilation, and I just stand there, shaking my head, arms crossed sternly. There is no tack through this chop. Elbows everywhere. When people quiet down again, Mona says, in grade school teacher sing-song, “And behavior is irrational. So. What’s that mean? That’s right! Thought is irrational. That’s the problem I’m addressing with these images. These are not thoughts, they’re thought-images. And I say: believe these images. Believe … everyone, or no one.”</p>

<p>I’m moving through again. The looks I’m getting now are more stern, that’s for sure. And why wouldn’t they be, for a sexist man-face, pushing his way sternly through to a woman who has complained, several times, that mistakes were made.</p>

<p>Together, I’ve corrected her: always together. Mistakes were made together.</p>

<p>After the cruise, the one where I fell off the rock wall, she claimed I had coerced something into being that she did not want. She was upset, to say the least. I sat her on my knee. I stroked her somewhat damaged hair, told her, “Don’t worry.” I said, “Trust life. We’re going to have a good life, no matter what. We do have a good life. It’s a fine life, our life. We’re making things better, all the time. We can’t do anything without making something better. Trust me. All you have to do is trust &#8230; If you can’t trust me, who can you trust?”</p>

<p>It hurts me right now, to think about feelings. Now, as I tug Ethan in my wake, I repeat after myself: “We do have a good life. It’s a fine life, our life. Trust, going to be fine, better, all the time, fine. Love. If you can’t love me, who can you love?”</p>

<p>With clear, watering eyes, “You’re right, Chad. You’re totally, totally right.”</p>

<p>How great it would be to hear that.</p>

<p>They say the strongest attachments are formed in the weeks following birth. And boy, are they are right about that. That really is the way it works. Ethan had become a small human, my son, and I was proud. Some descriptions are true, some accounts are real, some things are just fact. I’m the only person who has remained rational. I’m the only one whose beliefs are strong enough and right enough to bind me to them. The way things interact, the way events influence other events, the way people behave, the way causality can seem random, the elements that form the balance of the whole, the soundness of structures that have been designed specifically to support, to guide, to channel, to enclose, to separate, to distinguish, to emphasize, to maintain order. To control. No one can understand all of it, but a smart person can figure out enough know zero from one, right from wrong. I haven’t made any mistakes. Or, I’ve always nudged myself toward the better of two mistakes. I have a single voice, Jenna’s. Which sweet sound I only need to distinguish from all others, and follow the path where volume increases. Simple choices, binary, increase or decrease. Left, right, or keep going. Or turn around. Okay, that’s four choices, but still, not too many options. Not too hard to choose the right one.</p>

<p>It’s getting impossible to push through. And now, they’re pushing back against me and it’s drawn attention. The panelists have ceased all discussion. From the stage area comes only microphone hum. But I’ve got the real interloper in my sights, and now I’m right behind him and Jenna. I two-hand tap, one for her shoulder, one for his. But before either one can turn around, a booming of the speakers, a bellowing call to action:</p>

<p>“Improv Security Force! Now! RIGHT THERE! BOUNCE HIM!!”</p>

<p>She is on the edge of the stage, her pro wrestler finger aimed at my head. A barricade of females with linked arms distills from the churning of casually curious head-turners, blocking me from Jenna and her frotteur. I yell across the linked arms. I point my own pro wrestler finger at the stunned face of the man who caressed my wife. </p>

<p>I’m no slug. I could shoot faster than anyone in the western south central metro area. And I know how to hang on. When the weak bond of lady arms breaks, I go for the leg, yank the hamstrings to buckle him, down hard on his back, as a glossy hardwood radius magically appears in front of retreating sandals. His wind is gone, I’m sure of that, gone, but he holds, and then I break his hold, and he shoots, and I evade him on dancing toes, and I shoot, and I’ve got him good, but something’s pulling me. I feel a rain of small fists on my back. I hear screaming, and I’m surrounded, bodies everywhere. The screaming: their battle cry? Or is it Jenna? Now Ethan’s crying. I’m pulled back, by some ten armed monster, and that’s when I feel possessed of a strength of fury probably only known to Kung-Fu experts. I start flailing with every limb, a flurry of kicks, jabs, roundhouses, elbow shots, and I land one open-handed sissy smack to someone’s jaw that seems to provoke a battery of combat boots on my ribcage from different angles. There must be a thousand of them swarming on me. Jenna’s voice, again, this time yelling no no no! or is it go go go? Something very solid and very edged contacts my eyesocket full on, jacking my head back into something else very large and equally solid. Then the same from the side. The bucking bronco machine at La Palapa Loca: it is pretty much like that, in a bad way that makes me taste death. Like a real bucking bronco. Something else steps on my fingers, and then something else charges into my groin with ramming speed, and two starbursts appear on my closed eyelids, pop! pop! Ball-flashing pain into my abdomen, and I double up, smashing my face into something as I do, rocketing off the impact, occipital hammering against the wood floor. I slick my hand over my face warm and wet, try to clear my eyes, start to choke, taste puke, then stop choking because I can’t get enough air; then my eyes pop open and in my oxygen debt I catch a glimpse of something, a mass of people, faces, some passive, some angry, some in furious motion. Or is it one beast, some kind of hydra? Then an impact from I’m not sure where, on I’m not sure what, and black diamonds expanding in my vision, from a dense center, outward and outward, and a silence accumulating like snow.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>Picture them, together, in a lecture hall, 300 seats, overhead lights dimmed, projection slides crisp, the presence of others no longer threatening.</p>

<p>Darkness does that. Arms barely touching, pens poised over clean sheets. An advanced Acc&#8217;y class. They study together, twice a week, compare notes, memorize rules that govern systems of monetary exchange.</p>

<p>She met him once before, long before. When they were in eighth grade. All of the science classes were on the same field trip, out to the forest preserve, this swarm of awkward bodies ambling through the thickets. You know how those field trips go: they start out with the best of intentions. Some kind of pseudo-scientific prep for an expedition to gather buds, nuts, leaves, and such, notations of bird-sightings, cocoons, animal tracks, fossils (there are always false reports of fossils&#8211;don&#8217;t even get us started on arrowheads). Then maybe a talk or two, some kind of written activity, and invariably, at least two of them, one pair, end up on some sunny rock somewhere, after hiking off into the forest, far away from the shrill shouts and laughs of classmates.</p>

<p>They carried spider sticks. They stopped briefly to look at May Apples and speculate about three-leafed plants being poison ivy or not. They compared their teachers and their peers. They compared movies seen, books read, foods liked, best friends, summer camps attended. They both went to Camp Honey Rock! And they talked about Honey Rock. They weren&#8217;t there at the same time, it turned out. And Jenna started guiding him even though she didn&#8217;t know she was doing it, toward a place where she could hear cars passing. Cars going fast, blowing twigs off the road. Roiling the air. She moved him closer to the sound. She didn&#8217;t have to take his hand. He was brushing his hand against hers whenever he had the chance to make it seem accidental. She only had to move, and he would follow, as if linked. She was picturing a place where they would be alone. She didn&#8217;t know if she could find one where no one would discover them. And she didn&#8217;t know if he would do what she wanted when they got there. She didn&#8217;t want him to question it. If he acted confused, or nervous, or too aggressive, she would give up the idea. Whatever the idea was.</p>

<p>At summer camp, two summers before, she did some stuff with a counselor. He wasn&#8217;t that much older. It was the first time she&#8217;d done anything even remotely sexual with a guy. Afterwards, she wrote letters to him, but he never wrote back. The next summer, he wasn&#8217;t working at the camp, but he showed up, took her by surprise at the pool. He asked her to ditch Activities that night so they could go get pizza. He told her he was in love with her, so she said okay. After they had pizza, he took her for a drive.</p>

<p>Did he violate what they had, ruin her? She never saw him again after that, so maybe.</p>

<p>She was thinking, as Nick tried not to look over at her, as his sandy hair breathed limpidly with each step, of the kind of cabin you stayed in at summer camp with bunks and yellow lights. That was the kind of place she wanted to find. Then she could see the road, a glimmer of passing car, a splinter of pavement passing behind tangles of trees. The forest air cooled her cheeks. They were walking into a tiny clearing with a natural mat of leaves that had lain under the snow all winter, grayish but dry looking, pressed tightly against one another into a mosaic of flatness. She stopped walking. He faced her. He cleared his throat. She waited for him to speak, because anything he said would be the wrong thing. If he said the wrong thing, she would suggest they head back, it was getting late, the teachers might start worrying, but he didn&#8217;t say anything. She thought he might try to touch her or move closer, but he didn&#8217;t do that either. He just looked at her. He looked at her like he knew what she wanted. She stepped closer, right up to him. He still didn&#8217;t touch her. To make it clear, she told him not to touch her. The way she said it was to not to lay one fucking finger on her. He didn&#8217;t say anything. She made him promise it. He promised it. His hands stayed at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me,&#8221; she said. She was kneeling now. He was looking up, showing her the bottom of his chin, his nostrils, his breath steaming out across the empty sky. He must have been staring off into the trees. &#8220;Don&#8217;t close your eyes,&#8221; she said. He bit his lip, stared big-eyed.</p>

<p>At one point his fingers found their way into her hair and she pulled away, let him hang there, let his hand hang in the air before her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said don&#8217;t touch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slipped a love letter into her locker. She read it, felt moved in a way she couldn&#8217;t satisfy, crumpled it up and threw it in the bottom with her running shoes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not so weird for two kids from the burbs to end up downstate in the same accounting program, even for them to wind up in the same advanced Acc&#8217;y class, but maybe it is weird if later they run into each other in Cancún at the same hotel complex, just as she’s having a personal crisis of faith in her two-year relationship with a guy she&#8217;d only recently admitted to herself that she wanted to—felt like she should—marry, felt like marrying was the right thing, with this guy. And having a crisis about it. That she would run into Nick Scintilla again, during that crisis, and only then discover they were attending the same school and only then realize they were even taking the same advanced Acc&#8217;y class? That is a little weird, and it&#8217;s even weird that they would recognize each other.</p>

<p>They agreed to meet. And this was not cheating. A chillout period meant seeing other people was okay. Chad, no sucker when it came to personal treaties, asked what specific allowances that made okay. She said it meant anything was okay as long as part of their hearts were committed to getting back together after talking things through, next week. He didn&#8217;t like that, but too bad.</p>

<p>The BAV did alot of things that would have made her parents feel sad for the BAV. The BAV was her but it was also not her. She went to college a virgin. Had sex with him, then again, and again in the same night, then started having sex with him for real. What did that mean? To understand it at all, that first evening she met her husband, imagine feeling that you&#8217;d left your real self at home, a feeling like dreams give you, where things are happening to you and you only have limited control but it doesn&#8217;t matter because the real you is at home. She let him give her drinks, went upstairs with him, let him take off her clothes. She was only going to let it go so far. But because she let it go farther than she&#8217;d allowed in high school, she didn&#8217;t know anymore how to stop it. And a spiteful part of her was telling her she wasn&#8217;t really a virgin anyway, so what did it matter? So it happened, and then she was doubly not a virgin, and now it mattered half as much, right? So it happened again. And then &#8230; After the third time, she worried that she was no better than the person she&#8217;d tried to escape. But she was practically, almost engaged. She was lavaliered, for goodness sake! She was only chilling out temporarily. She was curious, this was an old friend. It was a long time ago, a lot had changed, she was curious. They never discussed the hike they took. She never mentioned the letter, and neither did he. That was all kid stuff. It was understood, this was understood: kid&#8217;s stuff. Now they were adults. They were embarking on something, on real life. They were sophomores, about to decide their majors. How weird that the last time they saw each other, they were on the cusp of the phase they were now leaving! It made them like old friends. They were somehow there for each other at the most important turning points of life. Like all you needed to really know someone was a moment, and then what they became, another moment, and the rest in between, you just know: somehow, you just know it. Somehow this way you could know a person better.</p>

<p>Chad, she didn&#8217;t know. She thought she did, and then he confused her again. She felt like she knew Nick better, instantly, because she had distance on him. Because she had distance for a longer stretch of time. Because they had both changed in so many ways independently of each other, but they could still feel intimate. And talking to him that night after she ran into him at the soda machine. They went to dinner. It was intimate. It was intimate, and real. He woke her up. He said: Why be so pissed about it? What better time to date other people? You&#8217;re on Spring Break, look around you, you can take your pick, you can sample all the goods. If you&#8217;re ever going to figure out what&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s here. He said this, and this was how she knew she really knew him, and knew him better than Chad: she knew he believed what he was saying, and that he wasn&#8217;t just saying it for his own benefit. True, it sounded fishy. It sounded like he was fishing for her. But she could see he wasn&#8217;t. She could see that he understood the situation, that it was not strictly for him. He really was encouraging her to do what she thought was right.</p>

<p>It felt so good to have a conversation with someone like that! So much better than Chad. Chad who spoke in such hyperbole and self-aggrandizing generalizations. With Chad, if something was a sometime-thing, it was an always-thing. If someone was an occasional trangressor, they were a constant transgressor. She only told him the things she knew would contribute to the absolutes she wanted him to believe. Instead of feeling natural in the relationship, she found herself at work. And she was usually working to control his perceptions, not for his sake but her own. So she could actually cope with the world. It was that bad. She couldn&#8217;t explain it very well to her best friends, but she was able to explain it precisely to Nick. That night, at dinner. He understood it in a non-binary way. And they had an actual conversation, where each person&#8217;s contributions helped further something beyond both of them, to build mutual understanding. Build it, not force it or unconditionally accept it. Not the clumsy, unproductive talkings-at she had with Chad. It was good. And it was the first time she&#8217;d had sex with anyone besides Chad since she was fourteen. And it was good. Seven times good. They did it seven times that week, and she counted them simply because she knew she shouldn&#8217;t. She knew counting was what the fourteen-year old Jenna would do, not the adult. But she counted them anyway, and she wrote some things down, saved some notes in a place she knew Chad would never look. We make 16,000 an hour. That&#8217;s what and what a minute, such and such a day. Where does it all end? And what fractional difference does any one make? She and Chad (I) made two of them, and it&#8217;s complicated, to try to say who wanted it more or less and who started what and what would have been different if. Mistakes were made, adjustments were required, but the joy is something she would never want to give up. And it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s fine that it worked out this way, the joy. Chad loves his boys. This is the best of all possible worlds. Couch that in academic language and you&#8217;ve got a valid sociological theory.</p>

<br/><p class="beat"><br/></p><br/><h5>•</h5>

<p>I’m afraid to move. Cold concrete, congealed motor oil. There is no hydra. No bucking bronco. No sandals. No tiny fists or combat boots. Only deeply buried honks from the street. And the pleasing sound of a massive HVAC system embedded in concrete. I notice I’m making tiny squeaking noises like the ones Jenna makes during Quiet-sex. The car alarm stops, and, still thinking if I move I’ll spill my guts, I wait a bit longer, hoping someone will find me. But the place is absolutely silent, and I’m thinking maybe I should just call 911 myself, because someone needs to. I roll away from the Massat tire, manage to pull myself up so my back rests against it and—note to self, all of this hurts—the pain is not a good sign, but on the other hand, it doesn’t hurt more than hard crunches—ab-busters we used to call them at wrestling camp—and I don’t feel faint or anywhere near death.</p>

<p>Though, look: the shirt is ruined. Bloodstains, ragged holes; tragic—one of my favorite Tammy Dill casuals.</p>

<p>I unholster my Moto (blood on the holster too, damn it), and flip it open &#8230; one bar on battery, no bars on signal. No way to call anyone. I undo a button of the shirt. I do everything slowly, like a skilled surgeon. There’s definitely blood, sticking in rivulets, and there are wounds too, but they don’t look bad. In the fold of flesh above my belly button are two tiny glinting dots, like the eyes behind that ski mask, beady little nothings.</p>

<p>Now I remember. A carrot peeler!</p>

<p>They’re so tiny that I laugh out loud. And laughing doesn’t hurt at all &#8230; so I laugh again. And I undo another button, lower, reveal my navel, some matted belly hair, then another button, lower; and there are three more of the little dots, plotted evenly just above the curving imprint left by the elastic band of my underwear.</p>

<p>The third one is slightly oblong and squeezed shut, like the corner of a smirk.</p>

<p>I laugh again, and it’s more of a hoot this time. I was expecting to see gaping holes—intestines, maybe, but these—these are scratches! I roll onto my elbows and knees, stand, look down the length of my body, like a powerful giant admiring his own height, and examine my slacks for damage. They are, after all, Dickers, with StainGuard nano-cleanse technology.</p>

<p>The Beamer may be gone, but the common sense that purchased it is still jingling around in my head. And it will buy me some time.</p>

<p>I bend forward and brush, with a tender touch, a gum wrapper from the pleat, a cigarette butt from the knee. No stains. Well-Guarded. I straighten up, breathe. Yes—yes I can walk. I make my way past fender after fender, beneath one caged light and then another, down a ramp, then another ramp. I follow the large yellow arrows next to the large yellow EXIT words on the floor.</p>

<p>Then I see the attendant booth, empty, and the gate, up, and my Beamer parked right under the open gate, driver side door ajar, no one in it.</p>

<p>I stop for a second, unsure whether this is still dangerous. Or maybe this is the actual joke, the punchline, so to speak. But nothing happens. Someone walks past on the sidewalk, leaning into the wind. The fine grains of snow trace lines across the lit sidewalk. I move again, limping less now, and then jog, over to my car. It seems unscathed, but I don’t examine it too closely because I just want to get in it and lock the doors. It’s completely vacant. No one hiding in the backseat either. And the keys are in the ignition.</p>

<p>I get in, slam the door and hit the lock button over and over again. I keep doing it for awhile, and still nothing else happens.</p>

<p>“Holy cow,” I say. “Holy cow, holy cow.”</p>

<p>I realize I’m hyperventilating. I try to concentrate. I focus on slowing down my breathing. One breath at a time. One. Two. Three. My hand on the ignition. Three. I start the car. I look out at the driving snow. It’s amazing. The radio kicks in, and suddenly Tom Dillmeyer is complaining so damn suavely about people on welfare buying sugary snacks and that’s why they’re fat. I love it. I shift, hear the drivetrain engage fluidly. Then I ease out, seeing the driving snow and the orange barrier gate jerking down in my rear view. I push onward. I imagine Jenna as she was that night, deliciously pregnant, completely nude from her lovely head down to the bare soles of her feet, devotedly performing oral sex on me as we both swooned to that powerful symphony, that masterful performance reduced to a soothing, succulent murmur in our sound system.</p>

<p>The turn signal clicks softly.</p>

<p>It’s not until the headlights in my rear view begin flashing alternately, and the blue and red lights above them begin strobing, that I notice the one thing out of place in the car: a sticky note on the dashboard with familiar words block-lettered on it:</p>

<p>JEANS, NOT GENES!</p>

<p>I stare at that as I let my foot up from the gas. I don’t brake, just coast. And then, pressing my mind to where I want to go, to the tender moments after our sexual congress, I’m telling her everything. In a nuanced, loving way. Everything I haven’t told her yet. And in the moment after that, just before we drift off to sleep, just before the lights go out one house at a time down the block, then once again everything will be wonderful.</p>
